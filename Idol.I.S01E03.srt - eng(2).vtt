00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:35.849
I haven't seen him lately.

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.144
-Yes, thank you so much.
-Yes.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:43.106
What do we do?

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:45.817
If we don't find him
before the investigation, we're screwed.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:48.111
He has been off the grid for days.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.656
He didn't just run off somewhere, right?

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:09.632
Hello, Mr. Do Ra-ik?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.968
Police station speaking.

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:13.678
Sorry, what?

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:18.266
POLICE STATION

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:25.857
Are you his guardian?

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.361
I am his lawyer.

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:32.113
He refused to give his address

00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:35.450
and yelled that he had nowhere to go.

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:37.535
Please take him home.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.544
Let's just drop him home.

00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:48.671
If we leave him nearby,
he'll go in on his own.

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.216
They said he refuses to go home.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.719
After all that, how could he return there?

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:57.138
It's his problem!

00:01:57.222 --> 00:01:58.806
So you're taking him to your place?

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.808
There are plenty of motels
or saunas around.

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:03.436
I'll take him somewhere…

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.605
If it's too much, hand him over.
I'll carry him.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:08.441
Forget it, no way you can carry this lump.

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.110
We are almost here, and you say that now.

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:19.494
Is he really an idol? Why is he so heavy?

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:29.045
What kind of torture is this?

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:34.050
This is not right.
Let me just take him to my place.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:36.386
How could he stay at your place?

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.721
You have wiretaps
and all sorts of shady stuff there.

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:41.557
Come out, hurry.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.395
-Still he is a guy, you are not…
-Just go.

00:02:45.478 --> 00:02:47.480
Fine, I'm going.

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:50.984
You don't even offer me
a glass of water.

00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:01.911
Is that the only reason?

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:04.956
What is with that disrespectful stare?

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.708
I just thought

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.294
it's the perfect excuse to unpack
all those sticky personal feelings.

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:11.421
That's not an excuse.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:15.341
If we dump him anywhere
and he vanishes, we're done.

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.969
Seriously, aren't you scared at all?

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:19.429
Scared of what?

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:23.725
What?

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:25.685
You mean Ra-ik might be a killer?

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:27.895
Yes. Honestly, you don't know yet.

00:03:29.272 --> 00:03:30.356
Aren't you scared?

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:32.358
I'm scared.

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:34.235
Right, so then--

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:36.529
Of course, I thought

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.990
what if he really did it.

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:44.579
What if all the support I poured into him
helped turn him into a monster.

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:46.706
That is what really scares me.

00:03:47.874 --> 00:03:49.751
But that's a different matter.

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.253
Right now, I'm his lawyer.

00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:56.507
So I must protect my client to the end.

00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:10.938
EP03
BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP FOR DEATH

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.133
I can't believe

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.261
Ra-ik is lying in my house,

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:45.139
in my room, on my bed.

00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:07.889
Don't go.

00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:15.479
Don't go.

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:20.026
Please don't go.

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:07.216
What?

00:08:25.943 --> 00:08:26.819
Are you awake?

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:32.658
That is a relief.
I thought you might not wake up.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:36.037
What am I even saying?
Get a grip, stay calm.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.543
Nice to see you again.

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:45.338
Mr. Do Ra-ik,

00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:48.549
welcome to my home.

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:59.602
Do you not remember?

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:02.355
The police called me last night about you.

00:09:03.272 --> 00:09:04.482
You…

00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:13.866
The police called me yesterday.

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:17.536
They said you were found drunk in a park.

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:20.456
I didn't know your door code,

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:22.708
and it felt wrong to drop you
at some random motel.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:24.960
So I brought you here first.

00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:28.464
Wait a second!

00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:31.592
Wait a second!

00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:33.552
It's a summons from the prosecutors.

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:37.556
If you refuse again, they may request
a warrant, and you might be detained.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.726
You can go if you want,
but you still need to take my calls.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.354
If you vanish again, it will drag me down…

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:01.455
Where are you going?

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.213
Attorney Maeng!

00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:13.259
You're letting him go just like that?

00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:28.983
The direct cause of death

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:33.112
is massive blood loss
from this stab wound to the chest.

00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:37.324
There are no defensive wounds.

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:42.747
When he was attacked,
the victim was totally unguarded.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.125
So either he never sensed the attacker

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:50.755
or the attacker was someone he trusted.

00:10:50.838 --> 00:10:52.381
I knew it.

00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:55.718
I keep telling you it was someone he knew.

00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:58.846
But here is the odd part.

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:03.934
The blade went cleanly
between the fourth and fifth ribs,

00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:05.853
piercing the heart.

00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:11.066
That means one single strike
caused a fatal wound.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:15.863
Didn't you say his blood alcohol level
was high at the time of his arrest?

00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:19.950
Plus, he had anti-anxiety meds
and sedatives in him.

00:11:20.034 --> 00:11:24.121
How could someone in that state
land such a precise attack?

00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:27.666
Well, maybe he just
swung here and it slid in.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.252
It could sort of happen.

00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:33.506
In general, it is very hard

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:36.842
to carry out something this exact,
while completely drunk.

00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:38.135
You're right.

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:42.556
You said the autopsy
would give us something.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.226
Yet we have nothing solid.

00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:48.604
The suspect interview is coming up
and we have no card to play.

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:51.649
I'm sure that lunatic did it though.

00:11:55.778 --> 00:12:00.366
You said no weapon was found at the scene
and Kang Woo-seong's phone is missing too.

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:04.537
If no one else went in or out,
where did all that go?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.373
None of this adds up.

00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:11.085
We are widening the CCTV range
and the time window right now.

00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:15.130
It rained that day,
so the footage is hard to secure,

00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:17.508
but we will get something soon--

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.802
You know that in a case

00:12:19.885 --> 00:12:22.429
where the suspect denies,
evidence is everything, right?

00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:23.764
Of course.

00:12:23.847 --> 00:12:26.934
So bring me proof
that ties him to the crime.

00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:29.937
-Then we will force a confession.
-Yes.

00:12:34.358 --> 00:12:36.318
Execute Do Ra-ik!

00:12:36.402 --> 00:12:38.445
-Execute him!
-Execute him!

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:41.198
Bring Kang Woo-seong back to life!

00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:42.992
-Bring him back!
-Bring him back!

00:12:43.075 --> 00:12:45.744
Execute Do Ra-ik!

00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:47.288
-Execute him!
-Execute him!

00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:49.748
Bring Kang Woo-seong back to life!

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:52.793
It's like that every day.

00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:56.088
Until recently,
I was busy pulling off fans

00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:58.757
who kept saying they loved Ra-ik.

00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:04.471
Hello, I am Jang Han-gu, Ra-ik's manager.
We talked on the phone.

00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:06.265
I'm Attorney Maeng representing Do Ra-ik.

00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:07.224
Yes.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.894
Please have a seat.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:15.399
Jang Han-gu,

00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:19.278
he's been with Gold Boys from the start,

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:23.157
and fans know him for his bad reputation.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.909
F***! Get out of here!

00:13:26.827 --> 00:13:27.953
Out!

00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:35.210
It must have been rough.

00:13:35.753 --> 00:13:37.963
I heard you found
the scene first that night.

00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:41.050
Well, yes.

00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:43.344
I still can't believe it.

00:13:43.427 --> 00:13:46.680
There was someone else there too, right?

00:13:46.764 --> 00:13:48.265
The housekeeper at Do Ra-ik's place.

00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:49.433
Mrs. Cheongju?

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:53.228
I heard she is the only one
with a key card to his place.

00:13:53.312 --> 00:13:56.357
I'm wondering if she has ever lost it.

00:13:57.733 --> 00:14:00.527
I don't think so, she's very thorough.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.863
She has been working at Ra-ik's place

00:14:02.946 --> 00:14:06.533
for nearly ten years
and nothing like that has ever happened.

00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:08.786
That's why he trusts her.

00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:14.041
He's right.
She's well-known among the fans too.

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:18.379
Ra-ik always mentioned her
whenever he thanked people.

00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:21.423
You can come in.

00:14:27.054 --> 00:14:29.848
Sir, this is Attorney Maeng Se-na.

00:14:35.396 --> 00:14:36.647
Hello.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.607
Hello.

00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:42.194
Geum Bo-sang, CEO of Goldie Entertainment.

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:51.537
He squeezed every last drop
out of our boys with no days off,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.748
and this is how luxuriously he lives.

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:59.169
And the second the scandal hit,
he hurried to review the contract.

00:15:01.046 --> 00:15:03.340
What a heartless bastard.

00:15:04.967 --> 00:15:06.468
No, it's just a rumor.

00:15:07.636 --> 00:15:10.639
We did review terminating
our contract with Ra-ik,

00:15:10.723 --> 00:15:12.182
but never carried it out.

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:14.768
Nothing has been proven yet.

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:16.937
But I saw a press release

00:15:17.021 --> 00:15:19.857
saying you were canceling
your exclusive contract with him.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.401
Calming the shareholders
had to come first.

00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:24.903
We needed to show

00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:28.115
the company was responding quickly
to the incident, that's all it was.

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:34.872
The night it happened,
you two were together right?

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:36.498
Yes.

00:15:36.582 --> 00:15:40.753
We had to settle accounts
after the concert.

00:15:41.628 --> 00:15:45.507
Did anything else happen that day?

00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:49.303
Anything like Do Ra-ik
and Kang Woo-seong fighting or something…

00:15:49.803 --> 00:15:54.683
No. They have never fought. Not once.

00:15:56.143 --> 00:15:59.563
I even spoke with Woo-seong
briefly that night,

00:15:59.646 --> 00:16:01.732
and he sounded totally normal.

00:16:01.815 --> 00:16:04.818
Around what time did you two talk?

00:16:04.902 --> 00:16:06.612
I don't know.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.157
What time was it? Let me check.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.158
Yes.

00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:16.830
You're here. Have a seat.

00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:19.208
It's Jae-hee and Young-bin.

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:23.670
They're in Gold Boys
with Ra-ik and Woo-seong.

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:26.882
This is Choi Jae-hee and Lee Young-bin.

00:16:26.965 --> 00:16:30.385
No one knows those two
better than they do.

00:16:30.469 --> 00:16:31.887
So I called them in.

00:16:37.392 --> 00:16:39.728
I am Attorney Maeng Se-na
from Cheon-un Law Firm.

00:16:39.812 --> 00:16:41.438
I am representing Do Ra-ik in this case.

00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:46.777
Thank you for your time.
I already had some questions.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.071
To understand what happened,

00:16:49.154 --> 00:16:51.698
we need a clear picture
of before and after.

00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:57.412
I heard you all met at Ra-ik's concert
the day before the incident.

00:16:57.496 --> 00:17:00.124
Could you tell me
more about what happened then?

00:17:06.964 --> 00:17:09.925
There was nothing special.

00:17:13.428 --> 00:17:18.892
But I heard all the members
were set to guest at his concert,

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:21.103
and it was cancelled

00:17:21.186 --> 00:17:25.190
-because of a conflict among the members.
-Who said that?

00:17:25.274 --> 00:17:27.151
How was your relationship
with Ra-ik usually?

00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:28.569
We were fine. Why?

00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:30.988
-Jae-hee.
-She keeps asking weird questions.

00:17:32.948 --> 00:17:35.492
I read all the gossip about you.

00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:38.912
You free criminals all the time,
and people tear you apart for it.

00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:40.873
-How can someone do that?
-Choi Jae-hee!

00:17:40.956 --> 00:17:42.833
Woo-seong is dead!

00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:46.086
Because of that psycho.

00:17:47.504 --> 00:17:49.173
Everyone knows

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:52.259
what he is like, how violent he was.

00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:56.054
He would smash things and swear
whenever he didn't like something.

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:58.098
He even beat me up on the concert day too.

00:17:58.182 --> 00:17:59.308
Beat him up?

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:03.395
Then the rumor about Ra-ik
hitting the members was true.

00:18:03.478 --> 00:18:05.230
Once you see this,

00:18:05.314 --> 00:18:07.149
there is no way
you can defend that bastard.

00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:11.570
Look. See what he did to Woo-seong.

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:17.993
-Ra-ik.
-Woo-seong! I'm…

00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:20.829
You didn't tell me…

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:23.874
Don't try to control everything yourself…

00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:31.006
There is no one. No one.

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:35.344
No one who truly believes
he's not the killer.

00:18:35.427 --> 00:18:38.639
The mother of singer Do Ra-ik,
identified as a murder suspect,

00:18:38.722 --> 00:18:43.018
has released a statement
about his alleged charges, causing a stir.

00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:45.562
In an interview, she insisted

00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:50.108
her son would never do such a thing
and firmly defended his innocence.

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:52.527
But she added that
if he did commit any wrongdoing,

00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:55.239
he should come clean even now
and atone for it…

00:18:55.322 --> 00:18:57.199
You should've prevented that!

00:18:57.282 --> 00:19:01.161
Because of that article,
our market cap dropped by 10%.

00:19:03.038 --> 00:19:06.333
Fine, I will deal with
cutting him loose or whatever.

00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:08.502
Just focus on shutting down
those reports for now.

00:19:09.503 --> 00:19:11.129
Wait…

00:19:12.756 --> 00:19:13.757
I'll call you back.

00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:19.012
It's okay.

00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:25.477
Where have you been all this time?
You wouldn't answer your phone.

00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:28.772
I've been looking for you.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.358
Why?

00:19:32.192 --> 00:19:33.402
So you can cancel my contract?

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:37.906
Tell me what happened with Woo-seong.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.366
If I explain,

00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:41.910
will you even believe me?

00:19:41.994 --> 00:19:44.913
That depends on the story you tell.

00:19:45.914 --> 00:19:49.418
Right now, just cleaning up the mess
from your ruined solo promotions

00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:53.547
-is already costing us this much--
-Woo-seong is dead!

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.842
He's dead, and you care only about money?

00:19:58.135 --> 00:20:01.096
To you, is that all he was?
Just another loss?

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.389
What about you?

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:04.808
To you, what was Woo-seong?

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:06.977
What are you talking about?

00:20:07.894 --> 00:20:10.439
-You know that he and I--
-No, I know nothing.

00:20:11.064 --> 00:20:13.775
You are the only one
who knows what happened that night

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:15.944
and who can prove that you are innocent.

00:20:16.903 --> 00:20:19.448
Until that is proven,
there is nothing we can do for you.

00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:21.992
Not even believe you.

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:26.663
So, in the end,

00:20:27.873 --> 00:20:29.249
you are just throwing me away.

00:20:33.045 --> 00:20:34.212
By now,

00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:38.425
your house and car are probably
all under provisional seizure.

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:42.387
Your mom took out too many loans
under your name.

00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:46.641
With this case, they think
you will never be able to pay it back,

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.144
so the creditors are moving very fast.

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:55.484
Even now, your mother is…

00:20:57.486 --> 00:21:01.031
taking money
and giving interviews everywhere.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.286
I'm doing everything I can
to contain that.

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:14.211
This is the last thing I can do for you.

00:21:39.403 --> 00:21:40.445
Mrs. Do Mi-kyung?

00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:45.742
"Maeng Se-na"?

00:21:46.827 --> 00:21:48.412
You came running the moment I called.

00:21:49.454 --> 00:21:51.123
How did you even get my number?

00:21:51.206 --> 00:21:53.750
You left your contact in a lot of places,

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:55.252
volunteering for interviews.

00:21:55.335 --> 00:21:58.255
It's my son. I have to give my side too.

00:21:58.338 --> 00:21:59.381
Is that so wrong?

00:22:00.006 --> 00:22:03.260
If you keep giving interviews
in the middle of all this,

00:22:03.343 --> 00:22:06.596
it can spread wrong information
or twist how people see the case.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.931
Twisted?

00:22:08.807 --> 00:22:12.519
I know my son better than anyone.
That is why I talk.

00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:18.358
There is no one else on this planet
who would take that brat's side but me.

00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:22.404
I gave him everything he has,

00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:24.656
and all I got back was betrayal.

00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:29.828
He sued his own mom for a bit of money.
There's nothing he wouldn't do.

00:22:30.912 --> 00:22:33.999
Ma'am, nothing has been proven yet.

00:22:34.082 --> 00:22:36.459
Yes, not yet.

00:22:36.543 --> 00:22:41.548
But he might have done it.
Then what? If he did wrong, he should pay.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.177
That is how I raised him.

00:22:46.094 --> 00:22:48.763
But still he's my son.

00:22:50.765 --> 00:22:51.892
How much can I get?

00:22:53.852 --> 00:22:55.979
-What do you mean?
-Come on.

00:22:56.938 --> 00:22:59.858
I know you're trying to make a living too.

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:04.779
Truth is always made
out of money anyway. Right?

00:23:05.614 --> 00:23:08.700
I'm just asking for a little courtesy.

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:14.664
Are you asking me for a payoff?

00:23:16.124 --> 00:23:18.627
My mouth's gotten pretty valuable lately.

00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:20.629
Even reporters are paying me.

00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:34.059
There's a song your son composed
on Gold Boys' first album.

00:23:35.977 --> 00:23:38.688
He said he wrote it
thinking about his childhood.

00:23:39.648 --> 00:23:42.692
I finally understand
why it sounded so sad.

00:23:45.278 --> 00:23:47.155
I don't know everything between you two.

00:23:48.365 --> 00:23:52.160
But there is one thing I do know for sure.

00:23:53.286 --> 00:23:54.746
Your son sang for people,

00:23:55.997 --> 00:24:00.168
so they could endure, lean on something,

00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:03.213
so they could find hope again.

00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:05.924
But it seems that song

00:24:06.508 --> 00:24:09.010
never reached you.

00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:10.679
Sadly.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.056
What are you talking about?

00:24:17.185 --> 00:24:20.313
From now on, I strongly advise you
to stop talking to the press.

00:24:21.064 --> 00:24:24.526
If another interview comes out
that harms Do Ra-ik even a little,

00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:26.987
I will file criminal charges
for defamation

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.072
and claim damages.

00:24:29.155 --> 00:24:31.741
I will use every legal option I have.

00:24:32.993 --> 00:24:34.035
Then.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.457
Hey!

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.636
How can people all be like this…

00:24:58.351 --> 00:25:00.020
Yes, Chung-jae.

00:25:01.313 --> 00:25:02.147
What?

00:25:07.193 --> 00:25:10.405
What do we do?
I told you to keep a close eye on him!

00:25:10.488 --> 00:25:14.617
He went in through the back door,
so I thought he would come out that way!

00:25:15.952 --> 00:25:19.039
If you had told me about the GPS earlier,

00:25:19.122 --> 00:25:20.248
we would not be doing this!

00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:21.458
If I told you,

00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:24.377
you would just call me a stalker again.
How was I supposed to say it!

00:25:24.461 --> 00:25:25.795
Anyway, just get here fast!

00:25:37.307 --> 00:25:40.268
-So you didn't text the others at all?
-I told you I didn't.

00:25:40.352 --> 00:25:43.229
If we said we'd meet yesterday,
you should've reached out right away.

00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:45.482
-Then you ask them to meet.
-Then what's the point?

00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:48.651
I mean, I was going to say…

00:25:48.735 --> 00:25:50.445
Those looks familiar…

00:25:53.156 --> 00:25:54.157
What?

00:25:57.952 --> 00:25:59.871
-Look at that.
-What is it?

00:25:59.954 --> 00:26:01.331
You idiot! Look close.

00:26:01.414 --> 00:26:03.208
Those are Nice Universal Gold Limited.

00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:05.001
Wow, you're right.

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.045
-Only a hundred exist worldwide, right?
-Right.

00:26:07.128 --> 00:26:09.005
-They must be fake.
-Let us check.

00:26:26.022 --> 00:26:27.107
Hey!

00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:30.318
Take them off.

00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:33.196
-What?
-Take them off.

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:35.448
-I can tell if they are real.
-I'm sure they're fake.

00:26:35.532 --> 00:26:37.575
That's not Universal Gold.
It's fake, right?

00:26:42.622 --> 00:26:45.083
Even trash like this gets to breathe.

00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:47.127
This punk lost his mind.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.295
Hey.

00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:51.131
-You got a death wish?
-Yes.

00:26:51.965 --> 00:26:53.216
Right.

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:55.885
I do want to die.

00:26:56.469 --> 00:26:58.221
So help me out.

00:26:59.597 --> 00:27:00.473
Kill me.

00:27:01.266 --> 00:27:02.600
Go on. Kill me!

00:27:04.018 --> 00:27:06.521
Wait, aren't you…

00:27:08.523 --> 00:27:11.568
Right? You're the Gold Boys guy
who killed someone?

00:27:12.402 --> 00:27:13.653
Holy crap!

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.405
Really?

00:27:15.488 --> 00:27:17.407
Yeah, wow!

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:25.123
Damn it.

00:27:29.627 --> 00:27:31.171
Stomp him!

00:27:34.966 --> 00:27:36.259
Damn you.

00:27:37.135 --> 00:27:38.178
Murderer!

00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:39.929
Damn.

00:27:49.647 --> 00:27:51.858
Hey! Your salary is down by 20%!

00:27:55.361 --> 00:27:57.363
Why is it my fault he went that way?

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:00.742
Let me come with you!

00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:20.553
Should I sell this?

00:28:20.637 --> 00:28:23.973
-This video will blow up.
-I am telling you these are the real deal.

00:28:24.057 --> 00:28:24.933
Let me try them on.

00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:26.059
-Get lost!
-Excuse me.

00:28:27.685 --> 00:28:30.146
Where is the owner
of those shoes right now?

00:28:30.813 --> 00:28:34.400
-Who's this lady?
-I'm the owner of these shoes. Why?

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:39.239
You want to hang out with me, right?

00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:41.491
You want to check out my shoes…

00:28:41.574 --> 00:28:44.160
-What the heck!
-Why are you blocking the way?

00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:46.871
Let go! Damn it!

00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:47.956
Move out!

00:28:49.082 --> 00:28:51.543
Who are you? Why are you picking a fight?

00:28:52.794 --> 00:28:54.087
You bastard!

00:28:59.384 --> 00:29:01.970
-I am so sorry.
-What is wrong with you?

00:29:02.053 --> 00:29:03.137
We don't have time. Talk.

00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:07.851
Where is the owner of
those Nice Universal Gold Limited's?

00:29:21.906 --> 00:29:23.241
Ra-ik?

00:29:24.158 --> 00:29:25.243
Are you okay?

00:29:25.827 --> 00:29:26.953
Are you hurt badly?

00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:29.497
Lift your head a little.

00:29:30.707 --> 00:29:32.500
-It is too loud.
-What?

00:29:32.584 --> 00:29:35.169
It's so loud, I'm going crazy.

00:29:35.253 --> 00:29:38.965
This damn song just won't stop.

00:29:40.174 --> 00:29:41.676
It keeps repeating in my head.

00:29:42.176 --> 00:29:44.095
Saying it should've been me who died.

00:29:44.721 --> 00:29:47.181
To end everything right now.

00:29:48.182 --> 00:29:51.019
But why am I such an idiot?
I can't even do that.

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:09.621
I know it was something…

00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:14.125
unbearably painful and horrible.

00:30:18.212 --> 00:30:22.550
I know you want to give up everything.

00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:32.352
But still…

00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:37.357
for the sake of the person we lost,

00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:39.859
we have to find the truth of that night.

00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:46.908
We cannot give up… until the end.

00:30:51.955 --> 00:30:53.539
Until then…

00:30:56.709 --> 00:30:58.086
I will stay by your side.

00:31:00.755 --> 00:31:03.049
Until you get every answer back.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.985
PROFILE: GWAK BYUNG-GYUN

00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:07.905
So the suspect is denying the crime?

00:32:07.989 --> 00:32:09.407
Yes.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.826
Right now, there isn't enough evidence
to get a confession.

00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:15.705
And the defense is pushing that
a third party may have entered the scene,

00:32:16.289 --> 00:32:17.707
which seems somewhat plausible.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.001
We may have to redirect
the investigation that way.

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:22.879
So the prosecutor
is redirecting the investigation

00:32:23.588 --> 00:32:26.132
based on the defense's claims.

00:32:37.602 --> 00:32:38.811
Byung-gyun.

00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:40.855
Yes.

00:32:40.938 --> 00:32:42.440
What do you think a prosecutor is?

00:32:43.024 --> 00:32:45.193
A prosecutor is a guardian of the law

00:32:45.276 --> 00:32:47.945
-who seeks justice and truth--
-No.

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:49.447
That's not what a prosecutor is.

00:32:50.323 --> 00:32:53.367
A prosecutor is someone
who gets a confession.

00:32:55.203 --> 00:32:58.998
With or without evidence,
once they choose a suspect,

00:32:59.082 --> 00:33:02.877
they don't let go
until that person confesses.

00:33:04.378 --> 00:33:05.379
That's a prosecutor.

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:07.465
Yes.

00:33:08.382 --> 00:33:10.510
It's a case of two people,
and one ends up dead.

00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:14.180
What's so hard about that?

00:33:15.932 --> 00:33:19.143
I apologize.
I tried to consider other possibilities.

00:33:19.227 --> 00:33:20.103
You know…

00:33:21.687 --> 00:33:25.149
how much effort it took
to get this case assigned to you, right?

00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:28.236
A case you can win
without lifting a finger,

00:33:28.319 --> 00:33:31.948
and with this much
public attention doesn't come often.

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:35.618
If you play it right,
and raise your value,

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.371
it'll lead you straight into politics.

00:33:40.164 --> 00:33:42.917
I handed you the prey everyone wanted.

00:33:44.502 --> 00:33:47.004
-Finish it without a mistake.
-I will keep that in mind.

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:51.759
And that defense lawyer…

00:33:52.343 --> 00:33:54.011
She went to the same high school as you.

00:33:54.095 --> 00:33:56.180
Is that so?

00:33:56.681 --> 00:33:58.933
But with over five hundred in a grade,

00:33:59.016 --> 00:34:01.185
-I can't know everyone--
-Among those five hundred,

00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:03.354
she kept taking first place over you.

00:34:04.063 --> 00:34:05.398
Until she dropped out.

00:34:06.691 --> 00:34:10.278
Her name was Maeng Se-na, right?

00:34:14.282 --> 00:34:15.700
Maeng Se-na.

00:34:17.285 --> 00:34:18.578
Maeng Se-na.

00:34:20.872 --> 00:34:22.206
Stinky.

00:34:24.292 --> 00:34:25.418
Stinky.

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:26.335
KILLER

00:34:31.883 --> 00:34:33.092
What now, Maeng Se-na?

00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:34.760
Poor thing.

00:34:38.723 --> 00:34:40.349
Stinky.

00:34:42.727 --> 00:34:44.604
Your eyes are seriously scary.

00:34:46.314 --> 00:34:47.148
What?

00:34:48.816 --> 00:34:50.568
Thinking of taking someone down too?

00:35:03.164 --> 00:35:04.332
Damn it.

00:35:09.253 --> 00:35:11.589
Talk about bad timing.

00:35:12.506 --> 00:35:16.344
Why did it have to rain that night?

00:35:19.263 --> 00:35:22.808
I keep replaying it,
but there's nothing to see.

00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:27.521
If the NVR hadn't broken,
this would've been an easy case.

00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:29.607
-What about the residents?
-Same as always.

00:35:30.399 --> 00:35:33.986
Whenever I try to ask around,
they panic about property prices dropping.

00:35:35.029 --> 00:35:37.740
-No one gives a straight answer.
-Rookie, you got anything?

00:35:38.574 --> 00:35:40.409
Yes, sir.

00:35:40.493 --> 00:35:42.286
Can you look at this? Something feels off.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.539
What is it?

00:35:50.419 --> 00:35:54.090
That night, he said he went to
the convenience store while drinking.

00:35:54.173 --> 00:35:55.758
To buy more alcohol.

00:35:55.841 --> 00:35:59.929
Right, but that's way outside
the estimated time of death.

00:36:00.846 --> 00:36:03.140
Yeah, but this part is just weird.

00:36:03.224 --> 00:36:05.893
He said he went out to buy alcohol,
but he didn't buy anything.

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:07.478
He just left.

00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:09.814
And

00:36:10.356 --> 00:36:12.191
he definitely came in from the right side,

00:36:13.317 --> 00:36:14.652
but he went out from the left.

00:36:14.735 --> 00:36:17.905
So I checked the map,
and that path is actually a hiking trail.

00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:19.573
Nothing around it.

00:36:20.825 --> 00:36:22.410
That's strange.

00:36:22.493 --> 00:36:26.163
Why would he take a mountain trail
when there's a good main road?

00:36:26.247 --> 00:36:27.456
Maybe it's just a habit?

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.834
He's an idol,
so maybe for body management.

00:36:31.627 --> 00:36:32.878
Nothing happens just because.

00:36:33.671 --> 00:36:35.381
Everything has a reason.

00:36:36.048 --> 00:36:38.301
Pull every CCTV within five kilometers

00:36:38.384 --> 00:36:41.595
between this store and that trail.

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:43.222
Okay?

00:36:43.306 --> 00:36:46.017
There's definitely something there.

00:37:22.136 --> 00:37:23.804
Back then…

00:37:27.892 --> 00:37:31.020
it felt like there was no place anywhere
in the world for me.

00:37:31.103 --> 00:37:32.897
GOLD CABARET

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:38.819
In a world so sorrowful

00:37:39.403 --> 00:37:43.491
With so many people breaking apart

00:37:44.784 --> 00:37:49.205
After countless years had passed

00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:55.920
A love suddenly appeared

00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:58.506
Maybe things will change
if I stand up there?

00:37:58.589 --> 00:38:01.384
One that had given its own life

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.433
Come out for a second.

00:38:09.517 --> 00:38:10.393
-Why?
-Hurry!

00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:12.228
Okay.

00:38:14.814 --> 00:38:19.777
A rose of love blooms only in a heart

00:38:21.737 --> 00:38:26.283
That knows true, sincere love

00:38:28.369 --> 00:38:33.040
Without hatred

00:38:33.124 --> 00:38:34.708
So I tried standing there once.

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:37.128
When you give love endlessly

00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:38.921
Only then did people finally look at me.

00:38:41.715 --> 00:38:47.012
Hundreds of flowers bloom

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:49.098
Ra-ik is really good.

00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:52.810
You can go to my beautiful
Long-yearned starland

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:54.770
Awesome, Ra-ik!

00:38:55.813 --> 00:38:57.148
But…

00:39:10.202 --> 00:39:11.287
Hey, sit here.

00:39:15.624 --> 00:39:16.750
Stay here.

00:39:22.548 --> 00:39:25.134
The place I had wanted so badly
suddenly grew too big for me.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.644
It slowly started to swallow me whole.

00:39:36.353 --> 00:39:37.855
I don't like that now.

00:39:38.564 --> 00:39:40.024
I don't like doing this.

00:39:45.946 --> 00:39:50.326
Ra-ik, you like singing.

00:39:52.953 --> 00:39:56.373
I already got paid in full by Mr. Geum.

00:40:00.503 --> 00:40:03.547
So you have to be worth the money.

00:40:16.977 --> 00:40:21.524
By the time, I realized
that everything I had was already gone.

00:40:32.785 --> 00:40:34.537
PEPPER FESTIVAL

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.413
A TROT PRODIGY - DO RA-IK

00:40:36.497 --> 00:40:38.624
GOLD CABARET

00:40:51.303 --> 00:40:52.555
You bastard!

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.899
That's when I met him.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:15.244
That idiot who stood beside me
and took every blow the world threw at us.

00:41:26.714 --> 00:41:27.840
Let's go.

00:41:32.052 --> 00:41:33.095
Take me with you!

00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:44.523
Thanks to that annoying kid,

00:41:45.441 --> 00:41:47.318
I could endure everything.

00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:01.415
The failures…

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.423
and the successes.

00:42:27.983 --> 00:42:30.736
When we were together,
there was nothing to be afraid of.

00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:33.822
There really wasn't.

00:42:41.914 --> 00:42:44.249
When did it become like this?

00:42:53.842 --> 00:42:55.469
Anyway, that's all.

00:42:57.221 --> 00:43:01.141
That night, Woo-seong and I just drank.

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:03.811
We listened to music,

00:43:05.187 --> 00:43:07.231
laughed, and talked.

00:43:18.534 --> 00:43:19.576
Then can you tell me…

00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:23.580
Do I have such a control?

00:43:25.374 --> 00:43:27.960
What happened that day?

00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:32.005
Where did you get this?

00:43:33.257 --> 00:43:36.218
Where it came from isn't what matters.

00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:40.848
What matters is
that someone saw you two fighting.

00:43:40.931 --> 00:43:42.516
We were not fighting.

00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:45.477
When we practice, we bicker
and snap at each other sometimes.

00:43:46.562 --> 00:43:49.648
The concert was close and I was on edge.

00:43:55.237 --> 00:43:56.071
Are you sure?

00:43:57.573 --> 00:43:59.116
Yes, I'm sure.

00:44:01.285 --> 00:44:04.121
Saying it out loud makes it clearer.

00:44:05.247 --> 00:44:06.665
I'm not the killer.

00:44:07.249 --> 00:44:08.834
So just like you said,

00:44:09.376 --> 00:44:12.755
I'll get my memories back.

00:44:18.802 --> 00:44:22.848
And my place got seized or whatever.

00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:27.186
So I think
I'll have to stay here for a while.

00:44:27.811 --> 00:44:29.396
What? What did you say?

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.648
Like you said,
if I stay at a hotel or something

00:44:31.732 --> 00:44:34.276
and run into people, it'll get noisy.

00:44:35.652 --> 00:44:38.197
And I don't want to be alone
in some unfamiliar place either.

00:44:39.615 --> 00:44:41.366
You said you'd stay by my side.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.497
MAENG SE-NA'S PERSONAL RECORD

PROSECUTOR GWAK BYUNG-GYUN

00:44:48.791 --> 00:44:51.251
How did that face turn out like this…

00:44:52.044 --> 00:44:53.962
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

00:44:55.172 --> 00:44:57.049
Summon Do Ra-ik to appear.

00:44:57.132 --> 00:44:58.967
If he ignores it again,
we'll seek a warrant.

00:45:03.639 --> 00:45:05.182
Prosecutor Gwak. Are you busy?

00:45:05.682 --> 00:45:06.767
Always.

00:45:16.401 --> 00:45:17.653
Wow, what a wide window.

00:45:17.736 --> 00:45:21.990
And the sunlight… amazing.

00:45:22.074 --> 00:45:23.408
Is that marble?

00:45:28.497 --> 00:45:30.040
Come on, just once.

00:45:30.123 --> 00:45:32.793
You know my father-in-law
is a major figure in the business world.

00:45:32.876 --> 00:45:36.463
Get close to our family and your career
becomes a highway, an Autobahn--

00:45:36.547 --> 00:45:39.925
Then why is your career path
like some winding mountain pass?

00:45:40.634 --> 00:45:43.720
Hey, don't be like that.
My sister-in-law is really pretty.

00:45:52.646 --> 00:45:56.024
Why should I show you my dashcam?

00:45:56.108 --> 00:45:57.568
You got a warrant?

00:45:58.402 --> 00:46:01.238
That damn warrant.

00:46:02.489 --> 00:46:04.950
Boss, he's not picking up?

00:46:05.784 --> 00:46:08.787
What is he doing? I'm going nuts.

00:46:15.377 --> 00:46:18.171
I've met Chairman Hong
a few times in private.

00:46:19.047 --> 00:46:21.675
He's been close with my father for years.

00:46:22.301 --> 00:46:25.887
And I went to law school
with your brother-in-law,

00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:28.223
so we've got quite a connection.

00:46:28.307 --> 00:46:30.225
So I only get one hour with you?

00:46:31.184 --> 00:46:32.436
Sorry?

00:46:34.021 --> 00:46:37.983
Family, job, weather,
even if we squeeze all of that,

00:46:39.276 --> 00:46:41.403
it barely lasts an hour.

00:46:41.486 --> 00:46:44.323
I heard prosecutors go on blind dates
three or four times a week.

00:46:44.406 --> 00:46:49.620
So I thought you just wanted
to rush through another boring one.

00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:53.749
Then what should we talk about
to make it fun?

00:46:53.832 --> 00:46:54.916
Well…

00:46:58.086 --> 00:47:00.255
What about the case you are handling now?

00:47:00.339 --> 00:47:02.174
I don't think that's a fun topic.

00:47:02.257 --> 00:47:04.384
Is that idol actually the killer?

00:47:04.468 --> 00:47:08.013
I can't talk about the case.
It could be an info leak.

00:47:08.597 --> 00:47:10.140
I don't think he did it.

00:47:10.682 --> 00:47:11.975
It's too obvious.

00:47:13.268 --> 00:47:16.647
Real life is not like a story.
Most cases do have obvious answers.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:20.317
But the arrest warrant was denied
for lack of evidence.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:26.406
Isn't the denial rate only about 20%?

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.450
You broke that statistic.

00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:32.579
You know quite a bit about the law.

00:47:32.663 --> 00:47:35.999
I studied hard
because I was curious about you.

00:47:36.083 --> 00:47:38.669
We might end up sharing a bed for life.

00:47:39.461 --> 00:47:42.339
I always want my team to win.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.342
Then you don't have to worry.

00:47:46.343 --> 00:47:47.969
For prosecutors like me,

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.849
one touch of the file,
and I know if it's indictable or not.

00:47:54.017 --> 00:47:55.268
Same with suspects.

00:47:55.769 --> 00:48:01.817
One look in their eyes
and I can tell if they did it or not.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.487
Isn't that a bit arrogant?

00:48:06.113 --> 00:48:07.614
What if they're proven innocent?

00:48:07.698 --> 00:48:09.074
That won't happen.

00:48:11.243 --> 00:48:12.577
That idol is the culprit.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.290
Your phone's been buzzing for a while.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.878
You're right. Excuse me.

00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:40.564
About Do Ra-ik's routes
I mentioned last time…

00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:42.190
That mountain detour.

00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:45.235
We found a taxi
that passed there around that time.

00:48:46.236 --> 00:48:50.824
But the driver won't cooperate.
Feels like he's hiding something.

00:48:50.907 --> 00:48:54.035
So you need a warrant right now?

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:57.372
Yes, right away. Are you out somewhere?

00:48:57.456 --> 00:49:00.292
Got it. I'll request a warrant
and call you.

00:49:24.399 --> 00:49:26.526
RECEIPT

00:50:18.286 --> 00:50:19.746
I can't.

00:50:21.623 --> 00:50:22.958
This isn't right.

00:50:26.419 --> 00:50:27.921
How am I supposed to face…

00:50:29.881 --> 00:50:31.174
Did you do something wrong?

00:50:35.053 --> 00:50:36.596
You said you did nothing wrong.

00:50:38.598 --> 00:50:43.687
If you don't go,
people will misunderstand you even more.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.817
And this is your friend's last farewell.

00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:52.112
You will regret it

00:50:53.113 --> 00:50:54.990
if you don't say goodbye.

00:51:16.428 --> 00:51:17.387
From now on,

00:51:18.763 --> 00:51:20.557
focus on just one thing.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.352
CHURCH

00:51:31.776 --> 00:51:34.321
Erase every emotion from your face.

00:51:35.906 --> 00:51:37.991
Mr. Do Ra-ik, do you admit to the charges?

00:51:38.074 --> 00:51:40.619
Do you admit to the charges?

00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:42.287
Please say a few words.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:45.415
How do you feel at this moment?

00:51:59.554 --> 00:52:02.265
Wipe out all fear
and anxiety from your heart.

00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:55.276
Focus only

00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:58.989
on your own heart.

00:52:59.072 --> 00:53:01.366
KANG WOO-SEONG

00:53:02.283 --> 00:53:04.119
Think only of this last greeting…

00:53:06.204 --> 00:53:08.039
to the person in front of you.

00:53:15.088 --> 00:53:17.424
Mr. Do Ra-ik, please say a word.

00:53:17.507 --> 00:53:19.050
-Mr. Do Ra-ik!
-Mr. Do Ra-ik!

00:53:19.134 --> 00:53:21.428
Please say a few words.

00:53:23.138 --> 00:53:27.350
I am sorry, but Mr. Do Ra-ik
is here to mourn Kang Woo-seong today.

00:53:27.434 --> 00:53:29.185
If you have questions,
ask the prosecution…

00:53:31.688 --> 00:53:35.692
Woo-seong was my one and only friend.

00:53:36.693 --> 00:53:38.778
I will do everything I can

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:41.906
so the real killer will be revealed.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:44.826
I will fully cooperate
with the investigation in every way I can.

00:53:44.909 --> 00:53:48.496
I will find the killer to the very end.

00:54:02.677 --> 00:54:05.013
I found it!

00:54:05.889 --> 00:54:07.932
Seriously.

00:54:08.016 --> 00:54:09.517
Hurry, look.

00:54:10.268 --> 00:54:11.394
What is it?

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.566
Here, this is Do Ra-ik.

00:54:17.567 --> 00:54:19.736
-But then…
-Yes.

00:54:19.819 --> 00:54:21.946
I knew there was something…

00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:24.908
Wait, what is that?

00:54:44.969 --> 00:54:48.306
What's his game?
Why isn't he investigating?

00:54:50.141 --> 00:54:52.352
You must be very busy.
We'll come back another day.

00:54:52.435 --> 00:54:53.561
Where are you from?

00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:56.022
Sorry?

00:54:56.606 --> 00:54:57.565
Not you.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:54:59.734
I meant the attorney.

00:55:00.485 --> 00:55:01.444
You look familiar.

00:55:03.655 --> 00:55:05.365
I won't answer personal questions.

00:55:05.448 --> 00:55:08.618
Of course. That would be rude of me, okay.

00:55:09.786 --> 00:55:13.289
Still the same. Arrogant and prickly.

00:55:14.165 --> 00:55:15.416
Excuse me?

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.501
I said, have a seat.

00:55:16.584 --> 00:55:18.461
I have something to show you.

00:55:18.545 --> 00:55:19.671
Have a seat please.

00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:31.182
You said you went
to the convenience store that night

00:55:31.266 --> 00:55:34.727
because you ran out of alcohol, right?

00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:36.312
But it shows

00:55:37.355 --> 00:55:38.857
you left empty-handed.

00:55:43.736 --> 00:55:46.698
I couldn't find what I was looking for,
so I just left. Took a shortcut.

00:55:46.781 --> 00:55:50.952
You mean that hiking trail
with no CCTV and no streetlights?

00:55:52.036 --> 00:55:55.999
But the thing is,
it takes you farther from your house.

00:55:56.916 --> 00:56:00.211
On a dark night,
with a friend waiting at home,

00:56:00.295 --> 00:56:01.921
you chose a longer detour.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.632
Isn't that odd?

00:56:04.716 --> 00:56:09.512
Prosecutor, your question
is based on subjective speculation.

00:56:09.596 --> 00:56:11.181
Please refrain from that conjecture.

00:56:12.307 --> 00:56:13.474
My apologies.

00:56:13.558 --> 00:56:15.768
But in our line of work,

00:56:16.352 --> 00:56:20.899
we take past events and drag them back
into the present every day,

00:56:21.482 --> 00:56:24.819
piecing them together
in a way that makes sense.

00:56:24.903 --> 00:56:28.281
To reveal the truth
someone is trying so hard to hide.

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:37.582
It took you about 40 minutes
to get back home.

00:56:38.333 --> 00:56:40.877
Even with the detour,

00:56:41.586 --> 00:56:45.173
it shouldn't have taken
more than 20 minutes.

00:56:45.882 --> 00:56:48.134
Why did it take so long?

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:52.889
As you know,

00:56:52.972 --> 00:56:57.518
any inconsistency in your client's story
is being recorded right now.

00:56:58.019 --> 00:57:00.897
How the court will see that,
is up to the judges.

00:57:02.732 --> 00:57:07.946
Let's not rob your client
of his last chance to be honest.

00:57:09.781 --> 00:57:12.158
I'll ask again.

00:57:13.159 --> 00:57:14.118
Mr. Do Ra-ik,

00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:16.579
think carefully before you answer.

00:57:17.914 --> 00:57:23.253
Why did you go there that night?

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.228
I told you.

00:57:40.311 --> 00:57:43.064
You have to tell me everything!
That's the only way I can help you!

00:57:43.147 --> 00:57:44.315
I told you, I forgot.

00:57:44.399 --> 00:57:46.276
How do you forget
something that important…

00:57:47.986 --> 00:57:49.445
You didn't forget, did you?

00:57:50.363 --> 00:57:52.907
You are hiding something
from me, right? What is it?

00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:54.367
I already told you.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:57.912
I went to the convenience store.
They didn't have what I needed, so I left.

00:57:57.996 --> 00:58:01.040
-I took the long way back for exercise.
-You expect me to believe that?

00:58:08.631 --> 00:58:10.717
Mr. Do Ra-ik, hey!

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:20.643
Is the interrogation already over?

00:58:20.727 --> 00:58:22.770
Why? Did you find something?

00:58:24.647 --> 00:58:25.732
We found it.

00:58:26.733 --> 00:58:27.775
But…

00:58:28.276 --> 00:58:30.570
-We found something and…
-What is it?

00:58:31.362 --> 00:58:32.530
Well…

00:58:33.323 --> 00:58:36.701
There's someone he met that night.

00:58:38.828 --> 00:58:40.580
And that person is…

00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:46.127
Mr. Do Ra-ik…

00:58:48.254 --> 00:58:49.672
wait.

00:58:53.384 --> 00:58:55.928
I'm your attorney.

00:58:56.554 --> 00:58:59.182
Do you not remember
the one condition I gave you?

00:58:59.265 --> 00:59:02.435
You were to tell me everything as it is,
what you saw, what you heard,

00:59:02.518 --> 00:59:05.229
even what you dreamed
on the night of the incident.

00:59:05.313 --> 00:59:07.690
I said I wouldn't take the case
without that.

00:59:07.774 --> 00:59:09.817
But if you are already
hiding things from me--

00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:11.110
I'm not hiding anything.

00:59:12.236 --> 00:59:15.114
I just got confused.
Everything's all mixed up in my head--

00:59:15.198 --> 00:59:17.241
No, you are lying.

00:59:17.325 --> 00:59:19.911
Your neck is turning red
and your eyes are darting.

00:59:19.994 --> 00:59:21.496
That's your lying habit!

00:59:23.206 --> 00:59:26.125
How do you know that?

00:59:27.543 --> 00:59:29.587
Only people really close to me
know about that.

00:59:34.634 --> 00:59:35.468
Attorney Maeng!

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:08.084
Ra-ik!

01:00:20.722 --> 01:00:24.308
We thought that person
was Do Ra-ik's accomplice.

01:00:26.644 --> 01:00:28.104
But it looks like…

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.366
She was trying to kill him.

01:01:59.278 --> 01:02:01.781
Feelings don't matter.
Ah, he's a guy too.

01:02:03.491 --> 01:02:07.245
At his age,
you think he's never dated anyone?

01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:08.579
What are you doing?

01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:10.248
Get it together, Maeng Se-na!

01:02:10.331 --> 01:02:11.541
He's just a client.

01:02:11.624 --> 01:02:13.417
I saw it that night.

01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:14.335
Answer me!

01:02:14.418 --> 01:02:15.461
Where were you that night?

01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:17.505
Do you realize
how cornered you are right now?

01:02:17.588 --> 01:02:20.174
How am I supposed to trust you
and defend you, Mr. Do Ra-ik?

01:02:20.258 --> 01:02:21.801
If I could,

01:02:21.884 --> 01:02:24.512
I want to be distant again.

01:02:25.763 --> 01:02:30.768
