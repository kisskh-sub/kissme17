=The Ultimate Vow, Unknown to You=

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.674
=Episode 24=

00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:10.996
From childhood to now,

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:14.876
I've been like someone
without direction,

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:18.236
desperately clinging
to the only familiar shadow.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.475
You became everything I chased.

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:23.876
Not because of love,

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:25.996
but because

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:30.236
I was too afraid of losing.

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.236
I mistook obsession for love,

00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:42.395
and dependence for devotion.

00:01:43.116 --> 00:01:44.236
Que.

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:49.996
We were both wrong.

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:53.796
I was wrong for not understanding love.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:55.996
You were wrong because

00:01:57.476 --> 00:02:00.115
you never saw my pain for too long.

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:03.516
I've done too many things
that hurt you both.

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:07.436
Young Lady Shen,

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:10.115
I don't ask for your forgiveness.

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:13.315
All the harm I once inflicted on you,

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:17.115
you may take it back.

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:19.476
It's just

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:22.796
I don't want to die yet.

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:28.796
There are too many things
in this world I don't understand,

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:32.796
too many truths I can't yet grasp.

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:39.636
I need time to find a path
that belongs to me.

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:43.236
Not for anyone else,

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:48.995
only to find

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:53.076
my true self.

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:54.596
Wen Ling,

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:56.995
I don't wish to repay hatred
with virtue,

00:02:57.596 --> 00:03:00.115
but I won't spill more blood either.

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:03.036
Perhaps we should

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:05.196
end it here.

00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:07.636
Qingru.

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:14.995
Let's go.

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:22.675
This time, I'll walk on alone.

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:42.114
My lords, bad news!

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:43.915
His Majesty has gone missing again!

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:45.595
After breakfast this morning,

00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:47.275
he vanished once more.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.155
He must have eloped again
with Young Lady Shen.

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:50.315
In my opinion,

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:52.475
Young Lady Shen is stunningly beautiful.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:55.114
It's only natural His Majesty
is infatuated.

00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:56.715
Though His Majesty often
leaves the palace,

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:58.915
state affairs remain well managed.

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.875
There's no need for concern.

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:02.395
Indeed.

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:16.514
This little one

00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:17.875
has been moving a lot lately.

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.835
Must be a lively child.

00:04:20.355 --> 00:04:22.915
Do you think he resembles you more,

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:24.396
or me?

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:26.796
I hope the baby will be like you.

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:29.596
That lively spirit of yours

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:31.554
it's what I love most.

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:33.515
There you go again,
acting like an Emperor.

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:34.716
Here,

00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:36.396
you're just my husband,

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.315
not some supreme ruler.

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:39.995
Only you

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:42.476
would dare speak to me like this.

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:46.435
In this world,

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:51.236
you are the one I cherish most.

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.275
Sir,

00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:12.475
since you've eaten well,

00:05:12.476 --> 00:05:13.596
it's time to pay.

00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:20.236
Well.

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:22.915
I don't have any silver
on me at the moment.

00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:24.475
You poor, miserable wretch.

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:26.114
How dare you eat without paying!

00:05:26.115 --> 00:05:27.435
Outrageous!

00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:31.755
Do you know who I am?

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:34.635
I am the Emperor of Mobei.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:36.236
Kneel at once!

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:38.156
Tch!

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:40.515
You're just an ignorant madman.

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:43.314
If you were truly the Emperor,
why would you be eating at my shop?

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:44.796
Get out of here!

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:46.155
If you're the Mobei Emperor,

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:47.515
then I must be the Retired Emperor!

00:05:47.516 --> 00:05:48.275
What a lunatic!

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:49.276
Get lost!

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:50.875
Out!

00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:52.915
Everyone, look.

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:54.236
This man's insane!

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:55.675
Insolence!

00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:57.395
I'll kill you!

00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:59.554
All of you deserve to die!

00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:01.276
I'll kill every one of you!

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.275
You all deserve death! I'll kill you all!

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:05.496
Here's the money for the drinks.

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:07.796
Young master, let's go home.

00:06:09.675 --> 00:06:10.836
Go home.

00:06:13.037 --> 00:06:14.475
Where is home?

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:16.720
Home is wherever I am.

00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:18.875
Come.

00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:25.195
I really am the Emperor.

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:28.555
I am the Emperor of Mobei.

00:06:30.115 --> 00:06:32.596
Yes, young master,
whatever you say is right.

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:34.095
Let's go home.

00:06:35.516 --> 00:06:36.995
This is my world.

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:40.195
My world.

00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:44.356
All should die.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:45.956
All should die.

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:50.476
It is my world.

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:53.956
All of you deserve death.

00:06:57.276 --> 00:07:01.276
Did Cui Di develop feelings
for Su Changji?

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:06.315
She said she once owed him a favor.

00:07:07.115 --> 00:07:08.836
And she needs a lifetime to repay it.

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:21.515
If we could always live here,
how wonderful it would be.

00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:23.236
This place is far
from the worldly clamor.

00:07:23.396 --> 00:07:25.075
It truly is paradise on earth.

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:27.515
After our child is born,

00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:29.596
we will build a small courtyard here.

00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:31.675
The peaceful life you desire,

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:33.194
I will give you all of it.

00:07:33.195 --> 00:07:35.836
Really? You promise?

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:39.195
Of course.

00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:41.796
Ru, whatever you desire

00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:43.716
in this world,

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:45.635
I will give it to you.

00:07:56.315 --> 00:08:00.115
The life of ordinary people is far more
interesting than in the palace.

00:08:00.675 --> 00:08:03.315
Look, over there,
making sugar figurines.

00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:05.236
And over there, doing magic tricks.

00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:08.114
This rattle...

00:08:08.115 --> 00:08:09.995
Slowly and carefully.

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:11.596
This rattle

00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:13.515
is exquisitely crafted.

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:16.836
Crisp in sound,

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:18.596
perfect for children to play with.

00:08:19.076 --> 00:08:20.195
Great.

00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:24.475
Then let's pick the best one
for our future child.

00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:26.114
Sir, you have great taste.

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:27.275
This rattle

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:29.194
made from premium phoenix wood.

00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:30.275
Clear, pleasant sound,

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.596
durable and long-lasting.

00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:33.916
Five coins each.

00:08:35.355 --> 00:08:37.036
Indeed, it sounds lovely.

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:38.674
Boss,

00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:41.594
I'll take all these rattles.

00:08:41.595 --> 00:08:43.155
That's not allowed.

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:44.915
One silver ingot is too much.

00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:48.076
Alright, thank you.

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:50.755
Look at this young master,

00:08:50.756 --> 00:08:52.275
how much he cherishes his lady.

00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:54.676
Even buying a simple rattle,
he is so generous.

00:08:54.756 --> 00:08:56.115
The lady is with child,

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:57.915
the husband treasures her even more.

00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:00.915
This is truly a couple blessed
by the gods.

00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:05.795
You, being the dignified Emperor,

00:09:06.075 --> 00:09:08.836
yet indulges in such love affairs,

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.716
like an ordinary man.

00:09:15.116 --> 00:09:16.395
In front of you,

00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:19.596
I'm just an ordinary man.

00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:21.995
Who needs the throne or crown?

00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:26.316
Look at these children,

00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:29.995
this is what a prosperous era
looks like.

00:09:33.916 --> 00:09:35.196
I've never seen you

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.436
so happy in the palace.

00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:39.436
Of course, it's different here.

00:09:39.675 --> 00:09:41.596
The palace isn't as fun as outside.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.676
So naturally, I'm different.

00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:48.635
I hope our child won't be unpredictable

00:09:48.835 --> 00:09:50.236
like you.

I remember when we first met,

00:10:21.116 --> 00:10:22.676
it was also at dusk like this.

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:24.235
Back then,

00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:26.236
you weren't yet the mighty Emperor.

00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:33.196
Whether in commoner's clothes
or as Emperor,

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:36.915
I've always been Che who loves you.

00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:40.275
Sometimes I think,

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:43.236
if I could do it all over,

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:46.474
I'd still choose to be with you.

00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:48.115
To meet you and know you,

00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:52.795
is the greatest gift heaven
has given me.

00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:58.395
I used to think imperial power
and wealth were trivial.

00:10:58.675 --> 00:11:00.076
Now I see,

00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:03.395
peace in the world is the most precious.

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.795
With you by my side,

00:11:07.156 --> 00:11:11.436
world peace is my greatest wish.
