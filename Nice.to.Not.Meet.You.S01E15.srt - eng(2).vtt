00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:53.476
Mr. Lim, I heard you
recently got back together

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:53.576
Mr. Lim, I heard you
recently got back together

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.162
with an actress you dated in the past
after being apart for a long time.

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:59.832
Could she be here with us today?

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:13.846
I'm sorry, but please refrain
from asking personal questions.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:14.763
No, that's fine.

00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:17.308
I'll answer the question.

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:21.604
You asked if the person I like
is here today.

00:01:24.732 --> 00:01:25.566
Yes, she is.

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:42.291
I can't tell you who it is,

00:01:42.374 --> 00:01:43.709
but the person I like…

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:46.545
is here today.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.472
I haven't won her over completely,

00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:58.349
but I'd like to use this opportunity

00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:01.018
to let her know how I feel.

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:06.982
Oh, just to be clear,

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:09.777
the person I'm referring to
isn't Ms. Gwon Se-na.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.029
It really isn't.

00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:15.366
I hope there's no misunderstanding.

00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:33.300
"LIM HYEON-JUN'S SUDDEN CONFESSION"

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:34.677
HE FIRMLY DENIES DATING GWON SE-NA

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.096
"The person I like is here today"?

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.305
What does that mean?

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.848
If it's not Gwon Se-na,

00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:41.475
is it a crew member or something?

00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:44.853
-Maybe it's just to create a buzz.
-Either way, Lim Hyeon-jun is blowing up.

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:46.188
The press conference paid off.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.411
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:04.456
-Hello?
-Why are you still here?

00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:11.463
Why are you staying behind?

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:13.882
Well, I just dropped a bombshell,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.135
so I'm keeping an eye on you

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:17.803
in case you pass out.

00:03:19.013 --> 00:03:20.014
What?

00:03:23.517 --> 00:03:25.060
-Were you shocked?
-Yes.

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:29.023
I was so shocked
that I couldn't even write my article.

00:03:30.774 --> 00:03:31.942
Why did you do that?

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:34.278
I told you a number of times,

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.697
but you seemed to brush it off every time.

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:38.657
So I just made it official.

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:49.126
No way. Have you seen this?

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.461
"Kang Pil-gu's girlfriend."

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:52.004
I hear she's a scriptwriter.

00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:53.672
I heard she's with the costume team.

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:55.758
I heard it's the executive producer.

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:57.509
-What?
-I heard that too.

00:03:57.593 --> 00:03:59.720
No, I heard Lim Hyeon-jun's girlfriend is

00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:01.680
Director Bak Byeong-gi.

00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:03.891
-What?
-No way!

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:06.393
Director Bak can't be his "girlfriend."

00:04:06.477 --> 00:04:09.563
Guys, you have to drop your prejudice
and open up your minds.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:13.192
Mr. Bak Byeong-gi was just a writer
until season four,

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:14.777
and then he suddenly became the director.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.944
Why do you think that was?

00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:18.822
The way they looked at each other
went beyond bromance.

00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:20.199
-No way!
-Come on.

00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:22.826
Not a single one of them got it right.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.705
There were more than
just crew members there.

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.166
There were dozens of female reporters too.

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:30.793
They weren't exchanging
romantic looks, though.

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:32.377
-I know, right?
-Yeah.

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.797
You know, they really do
look like a couple in these pictures.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.508
-I definitely saw sparks flying.
-Exactly.

00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:43.138
-Seriously?
-I think we went too far.

00:04:43.222 --> 00:04:44.056
AIDE WOO YOUNG-SUK'S SISTER-IN-LAW

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.182
MS. WI, CAN YOU COME
TO THE RESTAURANT TOMORROW?

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.230
SOME SAY LIM HYEON-JUN'S GIRLFRIEND
IS DIRECTOR BAK BYEONG-GI.

00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:53.524
-Is this for real?
-You make a good couple.

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:54.691
EPISODE 15

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.822
I'm bummed enough
about not having a girlfriend.

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:01.156
Do I have to deal with this too?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.699
I'm getting married next year,

00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:04.827
and my boyfriend's parents
would call nonstop.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.161
-Really?
-Yes.

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:07.329
They asked if I was two-timing him.

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.874
Come on, we don't have time for this.

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.835
Let's get ready for the shoot
before Mr. Lim arrives.

00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:14.920
Mr. Lim arrived a while ago.

00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:17.131
What? Where?

00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:20.175
This is what the script
should've looked like to begin with.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.388
Man, I knew Kang Pil-gu
was never a corrupt detective.

00:05:25.264 --> 00:05:28.058
He just pretended to be one
to take down the drug ring.

00:05:28.142 --> 00:05:30.686
It was all part of his plan!

00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:35.858
The director had a plan all along.

00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:41.655
Did we really have to
come to the set so early, though?

00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:43.907
There's at least an hour left
before they call you up.

00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:47.786
This is the last time
I'm playing Kang Pil-gu,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.830
so I have to give it my all until the end.

00:05:49.913 --> 00:05:51.874
Why didn't you just come yesterday, then?

00:05:52.374 --> 00:05:55.419
Finding your original spark
and giving it your best is great and all,

00:05:56.503 --> 00:05:59.756
but will you please act more rationally?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.300
During the press conference,

00:06:01.383 --> 00:06:04.469
my blood ran cold at the thought of you
confessing your feelings to her in public.

00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:06.930
Come on, I would never
confess my feelings in public.

00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:08.891
I just wanted to
give her a small surprise.

00:06:09.975 --> 00:06:10.893
Whatever.

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:14.771
Keep your dating life aside
and focus on your work on set.

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:16.690
Try to be considerate of the crew, okay?

00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:18.025
What do you mean?

00:06:18.984 --> 00:06:20.110
Do they not like me?

00:06:20.194 --> 00:06:21.069
No.

00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:23.488
They really don't like you.

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:25.532
"Really"?

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:26.450
Yeah.

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:29.036
Why "really"?

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:31.330
I did everything they asked me to.

00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:32.956
Do you want me to jog your memory?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.833
-Go ahead. Let's hear it.
-All right.

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:35.959
-Listen closely.
-Okay.

00:06:36.043 --> 00:06:38.128
Right from the start,

00:06:38.212 --> 00:06:40.297
you forgot your lines,
so we had to hold them up…

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.674
You call yourself a detective,
you damn idiot?

00:06:42.758 --> 00:06:43.759
Get the hell out of here!

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:46.220
Wait, you're not really leaving, are you?

00:06:48.847 --> 00:06:49.681
So?

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.475
Do you remember now?

00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:54.311
Once they watch
this season of Kang Pil-gu,

00:06:55.103 --> 00:06:56.980
it'll all make sense

00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:59.358
why I did what I did.

00:07:06.198 --> 00:07:08.909
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:07:08.992 --> 00:07:09.993
Have you

00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:12.287
given it some thought?

00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:14.331
I called you here because of that.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.583
I wanted to tell you

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:18.168
that I'll do whatever I can to help.

00:07:21.088 --> 00:07:22.256
Thank you.

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:23.799
Why didn't you tell me back then?

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:26.468
-Tell you what?
-That accident.

00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:28.387
If you'd told me the truth then,

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.597
I would have found a way somehow.

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:35.852
All that time I spent resenting you…

00:07:38.313 --> 00:07:39.481
feels so pointless.

00:07:39.564 --> 00:07:40.774
Back then,

00:07:41.858 --> 00:07:44.444
I was terrified
because I thought I'd ruined your life.

00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:47.823
Maybe I used the excuse of protecting you

00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:49.658
to run away from it all.

00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:52.869
I'm sorry.

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:00.043
I'm really sorry.

00:08:07.217 --> 00:08:09.344
I hate to ask, but I need to know.

00:08:11.179 --> 00:08:12.014
Jae-ha…

00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:13.932
Is he my son?

00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:21.940
I know that anything we say
will sound like an excuse,

00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:24.192
but we were only terrified

00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:25.944
that we'd end up like Young-suk.

00:08:26.653 --> 00:08:28.196
After losing him like that,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.824
I was so full of guilt
that I could hardly breathe.

00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:43.420
These are all the recordings we kept
of our conversations with Assemblyman Ha,

00:08:43.503 --> 00:08:45.964
along with a written agreement
that we signed with him.

00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.091
We believe this can be entrusted

00:08:48.592 --> 00:08:50.052
to someone like you, Ms. Wi.

00:08:51.053 --> 00:08:52.179
Thank you very much.

00:08:52.763 --> 00:08:54.097
The documents you provided

00:08:54.181 --> 00:08:56.350
will serve as the most crucial evidence.

00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:57.476
Ms. Wi.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:00.395
Please find out why my brother
had to die like that…

00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:03.190
and expose it to the world.

00:09:08.487 --> 00:09:10.530
I've gathered a lot of evidence
about the things

00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:11.990
Chairman Lee Dae-ho has done.

00:09:12.074 --> 00:09:13.367
That's good.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.286
I want this to be over soon.
I'm so anxious.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.454
Chairman Lee Dae-ho

00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:19.873
doesn't suspect you, does he?

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:22.250
I'm an actress.

00:09:22.334 --> 00:09:24.211
Acting is what I do for a living.

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:25.796
He knows

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:27.756
that we've been meeting.

00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:32.094
You can't release the article about him
right away, can you?

00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:35.639
No, not yet.

00:09:35.722 --> 00:09:38.433
But I'll release it, no matter what.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:44.022
Then I guess I'll have to
play along with him for now,

00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:46.900
at least until you're ready.

00:09:49.152 --> 00:09:50.028
By the way…

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:53.615
why are you making
such an effort to help me?

00:09:55.784 --> 00:09:58.412
Because I want to escape him,
once and for all.

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:01.123
I've tried to do it on my own,

00:10:01.206 --> 00:10:02.290
but it's not enough.

00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:05.919
I guess you could say
I'm taking out an extra policy.

00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:08.380
Don't worry.

00:10:09.297 --> 00:10:10.882
I've got you covered.

00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:18.682
I met with Wi Jeong-sin.

00:10:18.765 --> 00:10:20.392
I told her what you wanted me to…

00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:23.019
as if I was dropping a hint.

00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:24.563
I did what you told me to.

00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:28.066
Does it bother you
that I'm getting close to Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.317
It's not that it bothers me.

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:31.069
It scares me.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.788
These are documents from the shell company
Lee Dae-ho set up under my name.

00:10:41.872 --> 00:10:43.582
He not only laundered money

00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:46.751
but also faked sales
to embezzle company funds.

00:10:48.378 --> 00:10:49.337
Thank you.

00:10:50.338 --> 00:10:51.590
I know this wasn't easy for you.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.303
You'll need solid evidence like this
to send him to jail.

00:10:57.304 --> 00:11:00.599
That way, I can be free of him.

00:11:00.682 --> 00:11:02.767
Seeing how he even fired
Mr. Hwang from King's Back,

00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.603
there isn't much time left.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.771
You have to release it soon.

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:10.317
That's how we can protect ourselves
and King's Back.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.526
Don't you get the feeling

00:11:12.194 --> 00:11:13.987
that I'll be ruined this time?

00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:18.325
I told you that I have you covered.

00:11:19.284 --> 00:11:21.286
Regardless of your personal life,

00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:23.622
you're my informant, and I'll protect you.

00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.207
That's why

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:27.542
I'd like to make a suggestion.

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:30.670
Because I don't want you to end up ruined.

00:11:33.715 --> 00:11:36.259
Jeez, Gil-su.

00:11:36.343 --> 00:11:39.095
Why did you leave
such important documents in the car?

00:11:39.596 --> 00:11:40.555
Where are the car keys?

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.848
They should be in the car.

00:11:42.682 --> 00:11:43.725
You didn't lock the car?

00:11:43.808 --> 00:11:45.477
I'm sorry. I've been all over the place.

00:11:46.353 --> 00:11:48.522
Well, it's not like anyone
would steal this car.

00:11:48.605 --> 00:11:49.981
Just wait a second.

00:11:50.065 --> 00:11:55.278
IMPERIAL PRINT

00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:09.626
THANK YOU
WI JEONG-SIN

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:10.544
What's this?

00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:13.338
Mr. Lim, did you find it?
It's there, right?

00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:15.006
Why is this here?

00:12:15.715 --> 00:12:16.550
Hello?

00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:19.135
Mr. Lim, did you find it?

00:12:21.137 --> 00:12:22.931
-Hey, Gil-su.
-Yes, Mr. Lim?

00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:24.516
I'll call you back in a bit.

00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:25.600
All right.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.646
THANK YOU
WI JEONG-SIN, EUNSEONGILBO

00:12:29.729 --> 00:12:30.647
Who are you?

00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:34.276
What the hell?

00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:35.610
-What's going on?
-You scared me.

00:12:35.694 --> 00:12:37.112
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

00:12:38.989 --> 00:12:40.824
I'm really sorry.

00:12:42.367 --> 00:12:43.368
Fine, then.

00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:46.913
Accusing an innocent person of kidnapping…

00:12:47.872 --> 00:12:49.207
Unbelievable.

00:12:51.501 --> 00:12:53.837
THANK YOU
EUNSEONGILBO

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.717
If you ever need my help,

00:12:59.217 --> 00:13:00.594
will you give me a call?

00:13:03.972 --> 00:13:04.806
THANK YOU

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:05.724
EUNSEONGILBO

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:12.689
That's right, it was her!

00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:15.650
This is unbelievable!

00:13:17.944 --> 00:13:18.778
THANK YOU
WI JEONG-SIN, EUNSEONGILBO

00:13:18.862 --> 00:13:19.863
No way!

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:26.620
Hello?

00:13:26.703 --> 00:13:28.288
Hello? Where are you?

00:13:30.582 --> 00:13:33.668
-What?
-There's a very good reason

00:13:33.752 --> 00:13:35.670
why we absolutely must meet up today!

00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:37.756
It's something huge!

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.175
What do you mean? What is it?

00:13:40.258 --> 00:13:43.511
I found undeniable proof
that we were brought together by fate!

00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:44.596
What?

00:13:44.679 --> 00:13:45.680
Meet me in front of your place!

00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:50.518
Fate?

00:14:00.153 --> 00:14:01.154
What's going on?

00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:07.452
Please help me!

00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:10.705
Help! Hey, I need help!

00:14:22.342 --> 00:14:23.176
Goddamn it.

00:14:50.495 --> 00:14:51.746
Yes, I like him.

00:14:53.873 --> 00:14:55.542
It's the first time in my life.

00:14:55.625 --> 00:14:59.170
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

00:15:00.547 --> 00:15:02.674
I want to get to know you better.

00:15:05.051 --> 00:15:07.595
Not just in the small world of our phones,

00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:10.682
but out in the real world.

00:15:11.683 --> 00:15:14.310
Will you meet me in person?

00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:11.659
Jeez.

00:17:50.633 --> 00:17:51.467
Hey!

00:17:53.094 --> 00:17:54.178
Who are you?

00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:13.114
Are you okay?

00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:15.074
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

00:18:15.158 --> 00:18:16.075
Are you hurt?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.036
Damn it.

00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:24.918
Are you okay?

00:18:33.176 --> 00:18:36.304
That guy wasn't just
some pervert or pickpocket.

00:18:36.387 --> 00:18:38.681
He was holding a stun gun!

00:18:40.058 --> 00:18:41.392
My dashcam probably caught him.

00:18:42.268 --> 00:18:43.853
How dare he do that
in front of Kang Pil-gu?

00:18:44.646 --> 00:18:46.731
I'll check all the security cameras
around here tomorrow.

00:18:51.694 --> 00:18:52.904
What did you just say?

00:18:52.987 --> 00:18:56.574
Chairman Lee Dae-ho hired someone
to orchestrate Lee Jae-hyeong's accident.

00:18:56.658 --> 00:18:58.284
I know it was him.

00:18:59.327 --> 00:19:01.037
Calm down, now.

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:02.705
No one got hurt, so it's okay.

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:05.541
It's not okay!
You could've been seriously hurt!

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:06.834
I'm fine.

00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:09.796
Anyway, what did you want to tell me?

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.339
Something about fate?

00:19:12.632 --> 00:19:16.719
I came here in such a good mood
to tell you about a fascinating discovery.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.972
But that punk ruined everything.

00:19:19.055 --> 00:19:21.599
Don't let a loser like that
ruin things for you.

00:19:22.183 --> 00:19:23.476
So what's the fascinating discovery?

00:19:26.729 --> 00:19:27.730
Look at this.

00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:29.857
THANK YOU
WI JEONG-SIN, EUNSEONGILBO

00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:33.277
-This is my old business card.
-Right?

00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:34.988
Why do you have this?

00:19:36.072 --> 00:19:37.407
Was it seven or eight years ago?

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.867
Do you remember getting wasted
and climbing into someone's car,

00:19:39.951 --> 00:19:41.452
panicking that you were kidnapped,

00:19:41.536 --> 00:19:43.246
and going to the police station?

00:19:46.457 --> 00:19:49.877
We saw that she got in my car by herself,
so I'm innocent.

00:19:51.879 --> 00:19:53.756
-I remember!
-Right?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.216
But how do you know about that?

00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:58.720
That car is the one we're in right now.

00:20:00.346 --> 00:20:01.931
Drink that and sober up before you go.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.517
And don't hop into
someone else's car again.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.062
Oftentimes, it's not your fault
when something bad happens.

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:09.480
Don't tell me you're that man?

00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:11.024
-I am!
-Wait, really?

00:20:13.234 --> 00:20:14.110
Are you serious?

00:20:15.236 --> 00:20:16.279
See?

00:20:16.362 --> 00:20:18.781
All of this was fate!

00:20:41.012 --> 00:20:41.971
You should get going.

00:20:42.847 --> 00:20:43.973
I will after you head inside.

00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:50.396
So I was right all along.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.814
About what?

00:20:52.398 --> 00:20:54.317
What I said about the fine line
between cursed and fated.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.235
There's a fine line
between cursed and fated.

00:20:57.236 --> 00:20:59.906
Don't say that! It made my blood run cold!

00:21:02.784 --> 00:21:03.618
Good night.

00:21:05.203 --> 00:21:06.037
Sweet dreams.

00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.311
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin,
do you have a life to spare?

00:21:30.394 --> 00:21:33.606
I either make people give up
or simply eliminate them.

00:21:33.689 --> 00:21:34.690
That's how I do things.

00:21:35.233 --> 00:21:37.902
Now that I know where you stand,

00:21:37.985 --> 00:21:39.612
I'll have to take matters
into my own hands.

00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:48.121
Let me say this again.

00:21:48.204 --> 00:21:49.539
You could get hurt.

00:21:50.373 --> 00:21:51.207
Or maybe even

00:21:51.874 --> 00:21:53.543
someone close to you.

00:21:59.048 --> 00:22:01.217
Seeing how he even fired
Mr. Hwang from King's Back,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.885
there isn't much time left.

00:22:03.803 --> 00:22:04.929
You have to release it soon.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.432
That's how we can protect ourselves
and King's Back.

00:22:27.618 --> 00:22:29.287
Isn't it amazing?

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.538
It really is.

00:22:32.373 --> 00:22:34.000
In fact,

00:22:34.083 --> 00:22:36.043
it all started on the same day I met you.

00:22:36.127 --> 00:22:37.044
What do you mean?

00:22:37.628 --> 00:22:39.964
The beginning of the case
I've been investigating.

00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:43.759
That was the day the aide
who was going to tip me off

00:22:44.302 --> 00:22:46.137
passed away.

00:22:48.222 --> 00:22:50.850
Why are you digging into someone
that dangerous?

00:22:50.933 --> 00:22:51.767
Aren't you scared?

00:22:53.477 --> 00:22:54.520
No one else can do it

00:22:55.688 --> 00:22:56.647
except me.

00:22:57.648 --> 00:22:59.817
I've been holding onto this case
for a long time,

00:23:00.735 --> 00:23:02.195
and I want to get to the bottom of it.

00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:17.752
I don't see anything.

00:23:18.836 --> 00:23:20.171
Nothing at all.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.216
What are you talking about?

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:25.676
I don't see any signs
of the ratings bouncing back.

00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:29.305
Why are you even checking that?

00:23:29.388 --> 00:23:32.016
Kang Pil-gu is just going to
drag on like this

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:33.643
until it fizzles out.

00:23:35.728 --> 00:23:36.729
Mr. Hwang.

00:23:41.567 --> 00:23:45.071
-On that note, I have something to share.
-What is it?

00:23:45.154 --> 00:23:46.906
The next scene's lines have changed.

00:23:49.116 --> 00:23:51.327
-Is that the script?
-Yes, but…

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.745
Give it to me so I can memorize the lines.

00:23:53.496 --> 00:23:54.997
Right, but the thing is…

00:23:55.081 --> 00:23:57.041
-Wait, why is this here?
-Give it to me.

00:23:58.501 --> 00:23:59.335
What?

00:23:59.418 --> 00:24:01.045
ENTERTAINMENT DESK

00:24:06.592 --> 00:24:08.261
Ms. Wi, here's some cold medicine.

00:24:08.344 --> 00:24:09.971
But you should go to the hospital.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.597
What's this?

00:24:12.723 --> 00:24:13.683
Thanks.

00:24:14.558 --> 00:24:16.269
I'm okay. I'll leave after I wrap up.

00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:18.688
-Okay.
-Thanks for the medicine.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.821
Bak Byeong-gi, that crazy punk!

00:24:26.904 --> 00:24:28.906
He's seriously insane!

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.491
Come on,

00:24:30.574 --> 00:24:34.036
how am I supposed to memorize
the entire code of conduct today?

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.997
I'm about to lose my mind.

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:39.041
"Born at the time
of our nation's liberation,

00:24:39.125 --> 00:24:40.251
we serve our country…"

00:24:40.918 --> 00:24:43.504
"We serve our country and people

00:24:43.587 --> 00:24:45.339
and protect
the free and democratic society…"

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.633
You can't be serious.

00:24:52.054 --> 00:24:56.809
Kang Pil-gu is really, really special.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.021
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

00:25:00.938 --> 00:25:01.856
How lucky is that?

00:25:05.401 --> 00:25:06.277
Right.

00:25:11.115 --> 00:25:12.700
Kang Pil-gu is extraordinary.

00:25:14.952 --> 00:25:17.246
Kang Pil-gu is extraordinary.

00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:24.670
"Born at the time
of our nation's liberation,

00:25:24.754 --> 00:25:26.255
we serve our country and people…"

00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:33.596
Hello?

00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:53.824
Oh,

00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:55.242
apologies for being late.

00:26:17.807 --> 00:26:18.849
Please sit down.

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:19.767
Okay.

00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:24.522
It's our first
since that restaurant day, right?

00:26:24.605 --> 00:26:25.564
Yes, that's right.

00:26:28.275 --> 00:26:29.402
Bring us some tea.

00:26:30.236 --> 00:26:31.237
Yes, sir.

00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:38.911
I know you must be busy.
I'm sorry for making you come all the way.

00:26:40.329 --> 00:26:41.163
No, not at all.

00:26:44.166 --> 00:26:46.585
Why won't they let me in?

00:26:47.294 --> 00:26:49.630
Why only Hyeon-jun? What are they up to?

00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:55.594
You and Mr. Hwang seem very close.

00:26:55.678 --> 00:26:58.013
I assume you were upset
to hear about his dismissal.

00:26:58.097 --> 00:27:00.099
Yes, but nothing has changed.

00:27:01.308 --> 00:27:03.227
He's still handling my work.

00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:05.646
I'll get straight to the point then.

00:27:07.314 --> 00:27:10.067
You're close with Ms. Wi Jeong-sin, right?

00:27:18.534 --> 00:27:21.162
I don't see why I should answer that.

00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:25.583
I'd rather talk about
the turmoil in the company

00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:27.585
and Mr. Hwang's unfair dismissal.

00:27:28.961 --> 00:27:29.920
"Unfair"?

00:27:32.756 --> 00:27:36.802
I specifically told you last time
that I'd take care of the business.

00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:39.096
But it didn't seem like you understood.

00:27:42.808 --> 00:27:44.602
Oh, is that so?

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.662
Keep still.

00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:13.923
What are you doing?

00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:18.802
Damn it.

00:28:18.886 --> 00:28:20.888
Maybe it's because
the tea tastes off today.

00:28:21.472 --> 00:28:22.723
He just irritates me.

00:28:26.185 --> 00:28:27.478
I can't stand things

00:28:28.187 --> 00:28:29.188
that irritate me.

00:28:39.865 --> 00:28:40.699
Wait outside.

00:28:53.879 --> 00:28:55.005
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:28:56.715 --> 00:28:58.592
The reality seems harsher
than dramas sometimes, right?

00:29:02.263 --> 00:29:03.180
But in reality,

00:29:03.764 --> 00:29:05.599
things don't end as beautifully

00:29:05.683 --> 00:29:08.018
as they do in your dramas.

00:29:08.644 --> 00:29:11.814
If you want a beautiful life with Ms. Wi
as you see in those dramas,

00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:14.733
I suggest you stay quiet, all right?

00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:46.890
Set up an interview for me.

00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:49.310
All of a sudden?

00:29:50.019 --> 00:29:52.813
Make sure the interview
is on a reputable program

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:55.316
that will give our story real credibility.

00:29:55.399 --> 00:29:58.110
Not a popular program,
but a reputable one?

00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:00.237
Okay, I got it.

00:30:00.321 --> 00:30:03.907
I'll make sure it's a reputable program,
so don't you worry.

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:07.036
I think Ms. Wi is in danger.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.039
I'll need to be by her side at all times.

00:30:19.423 --> 00:30:20.424
Are you back, Jeong-sin?

00:30:24.887 --> 00:30:25.929
Hi, I'm here.

00:30:27.514 --> 00:30:28.432
Hello.

00:30:29.308 --> 00:30:30.851
Why are you all here again?

00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:32.645
Well, we…

00:30:33.646 --> 00:30:35.898
We decided to get together
because we thought

00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:39.068
a comfortable environment
could help Hong-sin

00:30:39.151 --> 00:30:40.736
focus better on his acting.

00:30:40.819 --> 00:30:43.572
-So that's why we gathered here.
-Oh, I see.

00:30:44.323 --> 00:30:45.324
Wait.

00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:47.326
Would you like to see Hong-sin acting?

00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:50.871
-He's improved a lot.
-No, that's fine. I have work to do.

00:30:50.954 --> 00:30:51.872
Please carry on.

00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:54.416
-Have some ramyeon.
-No, I'm okay.

00:30:56.377 --> 00:30:57.378
Get some rest.

00:30:59.588 --> 00:31:02.049
I'll see how it goes later
and invite her for late-night snacks.

00:31:02.132 --> 00:31:03.175
Okay.

00:31:04.468 --> 00:31:05.344
Let's eat.

00:31:28.701 --> 00:31:29.535
Jeong-sin.

00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:31.120
We're ordering fried chicken. Want some?

00:31:34.206 --> 00:31:35.040
Are you sleeping?

00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:39.586
Jeong-sin?

00:31:41.046 --> 00:31:42.464
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

00:31:44.341 --> 00:31:45.384
You're burning up.

00:31:45.467 --> 00:31:46.301
What?

00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:49.304
Are you okay?

00:31:50.723 --> 00:31:51.932
Let me see.

00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:53.475
-I'm fine.
-Wait.

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:56.520
You really are burning up.
You're not okay.

00:31:56.603 --> 00:31:58.063
What if it's serious?

00:31:58.856 --> 00:31:59.982
Wait here.

00:32:00.524 --> 00:32:01.692
I'm fine.

00:32:48.197 --> 00:32:49.615
You should rest a bit longer.

00:32:49.698 --> 00:32:50.824
No, I'm okay.

00:32:50.908 --> 00:32:53.160
No, you're not. This is hot to the touch.

00:32:56.038 --> 00:32:56.872
Oh.

00:32:58.081 --> 00:32:59.792
Gosh, this is really hot.

00:33:00.542 --> 00:33:02.085
-What? Right, medicine.
-I got medicine.

00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:04.213
-And here's some water.
-Thanks.

00:33:05.798 --> 00:33:07.549
-Here's medicine.
-Just leave it here.

00:33:14.306 --> 00:33:17.726
Wouldn't it be better to call 119?

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.269
Come on, 119 isn't a taxi service.

00:33:19.353 --> 00:33:20.687
I can get to the hospital myself.

00:33:20.771 --> 00:33:24.107
Why do you insist on going alone?
It's better if someone goes with you.

00:33:24.191 --> 00:33:25.692
I'll take you there. Get on my back.

00:33:25.776 --> 00:33:28.111
If it's the flu,
you might catch it from me.

00:33:28.195 --> 00:33:29.404
That would disrupt the whole set, right?

00:33:29.488 --> 00:33:30.781
You're right.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.159
Who cares about any of that?

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.829
-Let's go together.
-No, forget it.

00:33:36.912 --> 00:33:39.456
Hey, if I test positive for the flu,

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.874
I'm staying at a motel for the night.

00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:43.627
-Okay.
-I got all my stuff. See you.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.254
-Okay.
-But…

00:33:45.337 --> 00:33:47.506
Don't come near me.
You'll catch what I have.

00:33:48.215 --> 00:33:49.091
Jeez.

00:33:49.716 --> 00:33:53.011
Call me as soon as you
get to the hospital, okay?

00:33:53.095 --> 00:33:53.971
Fine.

00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:00.060
Oh, boy.

00:34:01.562 --> 00:34:02.896
This is all so sudden…

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.107
Will your sister be okay by herself?

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.192
She made it back alive from a war zone.

00:34:07.276 --> 00:34:08.694
She won't pass out
just getting to the hospital.

00:34:10.487 --> 00:34:11.697
I know, but…

00:34:12.656 --> 00:34:13.991
Gosh, that was pretty cold.

00:34:15.826 --> 00:34:17.494
Was Mr. Lim always like that?

00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:20.372
It beats me.
I've only been realizing it lately.

00:34:21.665 --> 00:34:22.916
He's breaking out of character.

00:34:31.008 --> 00:34:32.175
Darn, that's so loud.

00:34:36.138 --> 00:34:37.472
I should've gone with her.

00:34:38.307 --> 00:34:39.641
There must be construction next door.

00:34:54.114 --> 00:34:55.115
I tested positive for the flu,

00:34:55.198 --> 00:34:57.075
-so I'm off to a motel to quarantine.
-Mr. Lim.

00:34:57.993 --> 00:35:00.287
She tested positive for the flu,
so she's off to a motel.

00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:02.414
She has the flu?

00:35:02.497 --> 00:35:03.332
Yes.

00:35:04.249 --> 00:35:05.500
Man, I knew it.

00:35:05.584 --> 00:35:08.378
But why is she going to a motel?
She'll be safer at my place.

00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:10.213
A motel is too dangerous.

00:35:10.297 --> 00:35:12.007
There are so many thugs out there…

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.091
What?

00:35:14.217 --> 00:35:17.387
I'm just saying that my place is safer!

00:35:17.471 --> 00:35:19.139
Then shouldn't we head home

00:35:19.973 --> 00:35:21.850
and have Ms. Wi come back here instead?

00:35:21.934 --> 00:35:24.436
I think that's the right thing to do, too.

00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:25.854
No, what I meant was…

00:35:26.605 --> 00:35:27.773
Never mind.

00:35:27.856 --> 00:35:28.857
Here, it's…

00:35:28.941 --> 00:35:30.025
I'll just call her myself.

00:35:32.611 --> 00:35:33.570
Hello?

00:35:33.654 --> 00:35:34.613
It's me.

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:38.784
Why are you staying at a motel?
It's so dangerous.

00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:41.703
It's dangerous out there
with those shady guys roaming around!

00:35:41.787 --> 00:35:42.663
Stay at my place.

00:35:42.746 --> 00:35:43.580
Excuse me?

00:35:44.748 --> 00:35:46.667
Why would I go to your place
when I could go to mine?

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.003
You won't get any rest here
with all the construction happening.

00:35:50.087 --> 00:35:52.005
I'll text you my passcode,
so just go to my place.

00:35:52.089 --> 00:35:53.090
It's safe there.

00:35:53.173 --> 00:35:54.841
I'm going to a motel.

00:35:54.925 --> 00:35:56.885
-That was the plan.
-Just go to my place already!

00:37:21.595 --> 00:37:25.724
BEST RICE PORRIDGE

00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:38.487
Eat the rice porridge
while it's still warm.

00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:04.054
You're too tall.
That's why my clothes don't fit you.

00:38:04.137 --> 00:38:05.514
-I'll go wash up first.
-Okay.

00:38:05.597 --> 00:38:07.390
Mr. Lim, you can change into this.

00:38:07.474 --> 00:38:08.558
Oh, me too?

00:38:08.642 --> 00:38:09.935
Yes, make yourself at home.

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:12.312
Thank you.

00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:13.647
I'll never wash those now.

00:38:17.567 --> 00:38:19.986
Mr. Lim, I want to show you something.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.029
-What?
-Come with me.

00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:24.366
It won't take long.

00:38:24.449 --> 00:38:26.493
Come on, hurry up and come here.

00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:27.494
What is it?

00:38:27.577 --> 00:38:30.205
Gosh, I don't know
if I should show this to you or not.

00:38:32.082 --> 00:38:33.166
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.709
-You…
-What is it?

00:38:34.793 --> 00:38:36.753
You have to keep this
a secret from Jeong-sin.

00:38:36.837 --> 00:38:38.547
Otherwise, she might kill me.

00:38:39.631 --> 00:38:40.674
Don't be shocked.

00:38:43.426 --> 00:38:44.678
Ta-da!

00:38:47.305 --> 00:38:49.766
Man, I can't believe I did that.
I'll leave you to it.

00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:36.122
Get well soon.

00:40:36.748 --> 00:40:37.624
I miss you already.

00:40:43.129 --> 00:40:44.172
GET WELL SOON
I MISS YOU ALREADY

00:41:56.745 --> 00:41:58.580

EPISODE 1

00:42:58.973 --> 00:43:01.393
Who are you,
and what were you doing here alone?

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.063
Hello. My name is Wi Jeong-sin.

00:43:05.814 --> 00:43:06.815
Have a seat.

00:43:13.029 --> 00:43:15.281
I'm sorry. I have the flu,

00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:17.158
so I can't get too close.

00:43:17.784 --> 00:43:19.536
That's fine, I guess.

00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:23.915
Anyway, are you and Hyeon-jun dating?

00:43:23.998 --> 00:43:25.125
No, it's not like that.

00:43:26.126 --> 00:43:26.960
Then what is it?

00:43:28.503 --> 00:43:29.337
Answer carefully.

00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:32.715
I could report you to the police
for trespassing.

00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:34.551
Well…

00:43:36.761 --> 00:43:38.513
We…

00:43:39.764 --> 00:43:41.099
like each other.

00:43:41.182 --> 00:43:43.726
You like each other,
but you're not dating?

00:43:44.394 --> 00:43:45.228
So it's a situationship?

00:43:46.813 --> 00:43:47.981
Yes, I think so.

00:43:49.816 --> 00:43:52.569
But what are you doing here
without Hyeon-jun?

00:43:53.695 --> 00:43:54.696
I have the flu,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.781
and there are some things
going on at my place,

00:43:57.323 --> 00:43:59.200
so he told me to stay here for a bit.

00:44:00.952 --> 00:44:02.704
Yet he won't even let me set foot in here.

00:44:04.038 --> 00:44:05.832
I've heard a lot about you, ma'am.

00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:08.710
You have?

00:44:08.793 --> 00:44:09.627
Yes.

00:44:13.506 --> 00:44:15.800
I assume he complained about
how bad a mother I was.

00:44:15.884 --> 00:44:17.010
No, not at all.

00:44:18.052 --> 00:44:21.014
He said that as a child,
his dream was to be like you.

00:44:25.351 --> 00:44:27.645
Did Hyeon-jun really say that?

00:44:27.729 --> 00:44:27.770
-He's really changed for the better.
-Exactly.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:29.230
-He's really changed for the better.
-Exactly.

00:44:29.314 --> 00:44:30.315
I know, right?

00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:32.817
Who's up for a round of foot volleyball?

00:44:32.901 --> 00:44:35.195
-Let's go play!
-Sounds great.

00:44:35.737 --> 00:44:36.738
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:44:36.821 --> 00:44:37.697
Foot volleyball?

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.158
-Let's go.
-This will be fun.

00:44:42.911 --> 00:44:43.745
What's going on?

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.876
-He can't get up that early.
-Gil-su.

00:44:49.959 --> 00:44:50.877
Can you go to the car…

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.794
Mr. Lim?

00:44:51.878 --> 00:44:53.379
Hold on. Let me just…

00:45:05.934 --> 00:45:06.935
Hello.

00:45:07.018 --> 00:45:08.603
-Hey.
-Thank you. Bye.

00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:12.440
What's that?

00:45:12.524 --> 00:45:16.444
Oh, the scriptwriter's parents
grow cherry tomatoes.

00:45:16.528 --> 00:45:18.404
She brought you some
because you're on a strict diet.

00:45:18.488 --> 00:45:19.531
For me?

00:45:19.614 --> 00:45:21.032
-Yes.
-Why?

00:45:22.408 --> 00:45:23.910
-Hey, you!
-What?

00:45:23.993 --> 00:45:26.996
The crew does like me after all!

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.414
They "really" don't like me?

00:45:28.498 --> 00:45:30.708
Like, "really"? Don't be ridiculous.

00:45:30.792 --> 00:45:33.753
Man, he's so unbelievably naive.

00:45:33.836 --> 00:45:35.588
Didn't you see them earlier?

00:45:35.672 --> 00:45:36.589
They were badmouthing you

00:45:36.673 --> 00:45:38.550
and then scattered
when they saw you coming.

00:45:38.633 --> 00:45:40.468
And if they really liked you,

00:45:40.552 --> 00:45:44.389
they would've said something like,
"Would you like to play foot volleyball?"

00:45:44.472 --> 00:45:47.267
Then explain what happened
on the set during my break.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.686
Why did he come up to me, call my name,

00:45:49.769 --> 00:45:52.272
and pick off a loose thread
before making a heart like this?

00:45:52.772 --> 00:45:55.358
He probably pulled it off
because it was too noticeable,

00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:56.401
like this.

00:45:56.484 --> 00:45:58.403
Come on, you need to connect the dots.

00:45:58.486 --> 00:45:59.362
Then what about this?

00:46:00.488 --> 00:46:01.739
That's…

00:46:02.323 --> 00:46:05.535
She gave some to everyone,
and she didn't want you to feel left out,

00:46:05.618 --> 00:46:07.078
so she gave you a token gift.

00:46:07.161 --> 00:46:08.538
Don't be silly. A token gift?

00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:10.582
Then was this a token gesture too?

00:46:10.665 --> 00:46:11.708
You're ridiculous.

00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:14.002
Hey, give me that. They're all mine.

00:46:14.836 --> 00:46:15.837
Why did she give him that?

00:46:17.964 --> 00:46:19.090
I don't get it.

00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:22.135
Hello.

00:46:27.348 --> 00:46:29.809
-Sir, how about a coffee?
-Sure.

00:46:29.892 --> 00:46:31.269
-U-jin.
-Yes, sir?

00:46:31.352 --> 00:46:32.186
Well,

00:46:33.187 --> 00:46:36.608
I saw you all
talking about me a little while ago.

00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:39.986
But when I walked by,
everyone suddenly scattered to avoid me.

00:46:40.737 --> 00:46:42.905
Did I do something to offend anyone?

00:46:42.989 --> 00:46:43.990
No, not at all.

00:46:47.243 --> 00:46:48.077
The truth is,

00:46:48.953 --> 00:46:50.997
-we were talking about you.
-Me?

00:46:52.457 --> 00:46:54.584
Did you see Mr. Lim that day?

00:46:54.667 --> 00:46:55.960
We saw him together.

00:46:56.044 --> 00:46:57.378
Oh, right.

00:46:57.462 --> 00:46:58.296
Let me go!

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.467
When he launched
that flying kick at the thug,

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.719
it was like I was watching Kang Pil-gu
right out of the screen.

00:47:04.802 --> 00:47:05.762
Did the kick land perfectly?

00:47:05.845 --> 00:47:07.263
-Yeah, it did.
-Really?

00:47:07.347 --> 00:47:09.432
And he's been coming
to stunt school diligently,

00:47:09.515 --> 00:47:10.850
even with the injury he got because of me.

00:47:10.933 --> 00:47:12.185
What injury?

00:47:12.268 --> 00:47:14.604
When we filmed the action scene
in the abandoned factory…

00:47:14.687 --> 00:47:17.315
I'll be doing my own scenes today

00:47:17.398 --> 00:47:18.858
without a stunt double.

00:47:18.941 --> 00:47:21.944
You see, I was a bit injured at the time.

00:47:22.028 --> 00:47:24.280
I was going to push myself
rather than create a problem.

00:47:24.364 --> 00:47:25.990
But Mr. Lim found out

00:47:26.074 --> 00:47:28.534
and did all the scenes himself,
which ended up in his injury.

00:47:28.618 --> 00:47:30.453
He didn't even mention his injury
so I could avoid trouble.

00:47:30.536 --> 00:47:31.954
-Really?
-Are you serious?

00:47:32.038 --> 00:47:33.498
-I didn't know he was like that.
-That's incredible.

00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:34.707
What happened to him?

00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:37.460
Who's up for a round of foot volleyball?

00:47:37.543 --> 00:47:39.671
-Let's go play!
-Sounds great.

00:47:42.924 --> 00:47:46.260
Man, look at how red these are!

00:47:46.344 --> 00:47:49.055
They look delicious.
These are so precious.

00:47:49.722 --> 00:47:52.642
Hey, savor them.
Don't just stuff them down…

00:47:55.478 --> 00:47:56.479
Hello, Ms. Oh.

00:47:56.562 --> 00:47:58.064
-Have you been well?
-Hello.

00:47:58.147 --> 00:47:59.440
You're here, Ms. Oh.

00:47:59.524 --> 00:48:00.483
It's been a while.

00:48:01.734 --> 00:48:04.362
Mr. Lim, Ms. Oh and Ms. Seong
have made up.

00:48:05.571 --> 00:48:06.489
What?

00:48:06.572 --> 00:48:08.408
Come on, no way.

00:48:08.991 --> 00:48:11.160
They were at each other's throats,
pulling each other's hair…

00:48:11.244 --> 00:48:12.412
Jeez.

00:48:14.789 --> 00:48:15.707
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

00:48:16.249 --> 00:48:17.542
Please have a seat.

00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:25.508
Ae-suk showed up at my place.

00:48:27.719 --> 00:48:28.678
I see.

00:48:36.561 --> 00:48:38.771
Mi-ran, I want to apologize.

00:48:38.855 --> 00:48:40.648
I went too far.

00:48:40.732 --> 00:48:43.151
I hadn't acted in a long time,
and I was eager to do well,

00:48:43.234 --> 00:48:45.194
so I just reacted without thinking.

00:48:46.487 --> 00:48:47.822
But more importantly,

00:48:47.905 --> 00:48:50.575
I can't drag my son's name
through the mud.

00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:57.498
Could you please forgive me this once
for my son's sake?

00:48:57.582 --> 00:48:59.709
We already have a strained relationship.

00:48:59.792 --> 00:49:02.670
Do you think a single apology
will magically fix it?

00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:09.385
If you don't feel comfortable,

00:49:10.052 --> 00:49:11.095
I'll drop out.

00:49:19.187 --> 00:49:21.147
So we agreed to just work together.

00:49:22.607 --> 00:49:24.525
Thank you for your understanding, Ms. Oh.

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:29.530
By the way, I noticed
that Ae-suk finds you rather difficult.

00:49:29.614 --> 00:49:30.448
Excuse me?

00:49:30.531 --> 00:49:33.326
Anyone can tell
that you're not an affectionate son.

00:49:35.453 --> 00:49:37.288
All sons are like that, I guess.

00:49:38.623 --> 00:49:40.583
Ae-suk has been through a lot.

00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:43.044
Not every well-known actress

00:49:43.127 --> 00:49:45.546
could have the courage
to have and raise a child on her own.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:49.008
Imagine all the disrespect
she must've faced back then.

00:49:49.926 --> 00:49:52.887
No one has the right
to point fingers at her.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:55.765
Not even her own child.

00:50:00.394 --> 00:50:01.479
I'll get going now.

00:50:02.605 --> 00:50:03.481
Right.

00:50:24.752 --> 00:50:26.754
We're done!

00:50:27.964 --> 00:50:29.632
-Good work, sir.
-Great job.

00:50:29.715 --> 00:50:31.425
-Good work today.
-Goodbye.

00:50:31.509 --> 00:50:32.885
-Mr. Lim!
-Yeah?

00:50:32.969 --> 00:50:34.595
How about foot volleyball
if your ankle's okay?

00:50:34.679 --> 00:50:35.555
Foot volleyball?

00:50:36.514 --> 00:50:38.808
-Me?
-Yes, but it's fine if you can't.

00:50:38.891 --> 00:50:41.727
-No, not at all. My ankle's fine.
-It is?

00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:43.062
I'm done for the day, right?

00:50:43.145 --> 00:50:44.021
Right.

00:50:44.105 --> 00:50:46.023
-Okay, let me go and get changed.
-Sure.

00:50:46.524 --> 00:50:47.358
Mr. Hwang, join us.

00:50:59.996 --> 00:51:00.997
I'm fine.

00:51:24.729 --> 00:51:27.607
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:28.858
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

00:51:29.817 --> 00:51:31.944
-Kang Pil-gu!
-Kang Pil-gu!

00:51:44.123 --> 00:51:45.416
He said that as a child,

00:51:45.499 --> 00:51:47.251
his dream was to be like you.

00:51:48.836 --> 00:51:50.671
Did Hyeon-jun really say that?

00:51:51.297 --> 00:51:52.131
Yes.

00:51:52.715 --> 00:51:54.258
I don't know for sure,

00:51:55.176 --> 00:51:56.886
but it seems to me

00:51:57.803 --> 00:51:59.972
that he admired you a lot
when he was young.

00:52:00.473 --> 00:52:02.767
Maybe that's when he started dreaming

00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:05.061
of becoming an actor.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:11.984
That's a generous interpretation.

00:52:16.364 --> 00:52:17.615
But my son hates me.

00:52:18.366 --> 00:52:21.202
I put him through a lot,
both physically and emotionally.

00:52:22.119 --> 00:52:24.038
Even so, thanks to him,

00:52:24.872 --> 00:52:27.041
I've been able to live a good life.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.251
Could I ask…

00:52:30.878 --> 00:52:33.005
if you've ever thanked him?

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:38.010
Of course, I'm thankful.

00:52:38.803 --> 00:52:40.972
But saying it out loud is a bit awkward.

00:52:41.722 --> 00:52:45.309
To be honest, I'm not very good
at saying thank you myself.

00:52:45.393 --> 00:52:47.395
But I read in a book

00:52:48.145 --> 00:52:50.982
that the least you can do for someone

00:52:51.816 --> 00:52:54.068
who's brought you happiness and peace…

00:52:55.778 --> 00:52:57.405
is to express your thanks.

00:53:02.034 --> 00:53:02.952
Hyeon-jun.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.162
Thank you.

00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:06.831
Thank…

00:53:07.748 --> 00:53:10.334
Thank you, Hyeon-jun.
Hyeon-jun, thank you.

00:53:11.043 --> 00:53:12.753
Thank you, Hyeon-jun.

00:53:13.462 --> 00:53:14.422
Thanks.

00:53:15.006 --> 00:53:17.800
Thank you. Hyeon-jun, thank you.

00:53:17.883 --> 00:53:19.260
Hyeon-jun, thank you.

00:53:21.345 --> 00:53:22.430
Thank you, son.

00:53:22.513 --> 00:53:24.306
Thank you, Hyeon-jun, my son.

00:53:29.603 --> 00:53:30.438
Wait a minute.

00:53:30.938 --> 00:53:31.856
That's not it.

00:53:33.357 --> 00:53:35.735
Thank you, son.

00:53:38.863 --> 00:53:40.656
-See you later.
-Thank you!

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.412
-We did great.
-Awesome job.

00:53:46.495 --> 00:53:48.581
Mr. Lim, that was the best teamwork ever.

00:53:48.664 --> 00:53:51.417
-Great job, guys. That was fun.
-You were amazing.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.294
-Great job today.
-Good job.

00:53:53.377 --> 00:53:54.462
Great job, you guys.

00:53:56.464 --> 00:53:58.841
Why do you put more effort
into foot volleyball than acting?

00:53:58.924 --> 00:54:01.177
What do you mean? I put effort into both.

00:54:02.219 --> 00:54:03.929
Are you going to Ms. Wi's place again?

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.390
-Yeah, I should.
-Ms. Wi's place?

00:54:09.226 --> 00:54:11.312
They've already gotten that close?
Since when?

00:54:11.395 --> 00:54:13.397
-Quiet.
-Since when?

00:54:14.148 --> 00:54:16.901
I feel much better now,
so I came back home.

00:54:17.693 --> 00:54:19.361
Let's return to our own homes today.

00:54:20.071 --> 00:54:23.032
Thanks to you,
I was able to recover in a nice place.

00:54:40.758 --> 00:54:41.842
Mom, you're here.

00:54:42.343 --> 00:54:44.303
Goodness. Are you just getting in?

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:49.100
They had fresh baby octopus
at the grocery store,

00:54:49.183 --> 00:54:50.309
so I made octopus soup.

00:54:50.976 --> 00:54:52.937
You like baby octopus, remember?

00:54:54.522 --> 00:54:57.399
Oh, I like baby octopus?

00:54:58.984 --> 00:55:01.028
Right, baby octopus. That sounds good.

00:55:01.112 --> 00:55:03.280
I mean, I like baby octopus.

00:55:04.698 --> 00:55:05.533
Hyeon-jun.

00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:11.247
Thank you.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.585
It's been rough for you, hasn't it?

00:55:19.171 --> 00:55:23.050
Thanks to your hard work,
I've been able to live a good life.

00:55:23.134 --> 00:55:25.386
It's not that I'm unaware of it.

00:55:25.886 --> 00:55:28.055
But seeing you do well
and living comfortably

00:55:29.014 --> 00:55:30.683
made me want to forget it all.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.770
I didn't want to think about
those miserable days anymore.

00:55:36.272 --> 00:55:37.189
I think that's why…

00:55:39.483 --> 00:55:41.569
I was reluctant to say thank you.

00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:43.571
Jun.

00:55:47.825 --> 00:55:48.868
Thank you.

00:55:51.203 --> 00:55:52.037
And I'm sorry.

00:55:57.918 --> 00:56:00.546
I've given it a lot of thought.

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:02.673
And…

00:56:03.799 --> 00:56:06.844
this is the only thing I can do for you.

00:56:08.596 --> 00:56:09.597
I'll come every day…

00:56:12.099 --> 00:56:13.684
and cook for you.

00:56:25.487 --> 00:56:26.655
Jeez.

00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:30.242
What do you mean,
you haven't done much for me?

00:56:31.076 --> 00:56:32.494
You've done plenty for me.

00:56:32.995 --> 00:56:36.624
So don't think like that anymore, okay?

00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:39.668
And also…

00:56:39.752 --> 00:56:41.045
You don't have to come every day.

00:56:41.879 --> 00:56:44.048
There's no need for that.

00:56:45.507 --> 00:56:46.342
Let's eat.

00:56:47.343 --> 00:56:48.469
And don't come every day.

00:57:06.487 --> 00:57:07.446
Hi, I'm here.

00:57:07.529 --> 00:57:08.405
Yeah.

00:57:08.989 --> 00:57:12.117
Why are you here at this hour, though?
Did something happen?

00:57:12.201 --> 00:57:14.286
You said to call if I needed your help.

00:57:16.413 --> 00:57:18.165
If you ever need my help,

00:57:19.166 --> 00:57:20.376
will you give me a call?

00:57:26.298 --> 00:57:27.132
What is it?

00:57:27.841 --> 00:57:29.093
What do you need my help with?

00:57:29.176 --> 00:57:31.428
You owe me an article, remember?

00:57:33.555 --> 00:57:35.432
I owe you an article?

00:57:35.516 --> 00:57:38.394
That time when we followed
Mr. Yoon Jung-ho all the way to Gangneung.

00:57:38.477 --> 00:57:41.146
You promised to write an article
I asked you to.

00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:44.650
But I'm willing to let all that go
for a single article.

00:57:44.733 --> 00:57:46.777
I never take requests for articles,

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.863
but I'll make an exception
under the condition that it's totally true

00:57:51.282 --> 00:57:52.157
and newsworthy.

00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:53.200
Good.

00:57:54.118 --> 00:57:55.911
From this point on, you owe me an article.

00:57:55.995 --> 00:57:58.497
Oh, you're right.

00:57:59.415 --> 00:58:02.418
But are you really going to
cash in that favor?

00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:03.585
Of course.

00:58:04.586 --> 00:58:07.214
I'm going to ask you
for a big favor today.

00:58:09.383 --> 00:58:11.677
I'm cashing in the article you owe me,

00:58:12.261 --> 00:58:16.974
as well as the offer you made me
when you accused me of being a kidnapper.

00:58:18.017 --> 00:58:19.476
I'm cashing in all my favors.

00:58:21.478 --> 00:58:22.479
What's the favor?

00:58:24.064 --> 00:58:24.898
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

00:58:27.484 --> 00:58:28.986
Let's take him down.

00:58:31.405 --> 00:58:32.406
Together.

00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:40.664
You're watching
our star interview on YTM News.

00:58:40.748 --> 00:58:42.291
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na from

00:58:42.374 --> 00:58:45.002
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu
are here with us today.

00:58:45.085 --> 00:58:46.420
It's nice to meet you both.

00:58:46.503 --> 00:58:47.755
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

00:58:48.255 --> 00:58:49.798
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun,

00:58:49.882 --> 00:58:51.967
and I play Kang Pil-gu
in Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:58:52.051 --> 00:58:53.302
Hello.

00:58:53.385 --> 00:58:56.180
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

00:58:58.766 --> 00:59:02.811
I apologize for raising an issue like this
during our drama promotion segment,

00:59:02.895 --> 00:59:04.646
but I've invited a guest today

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.857
to shed more light
on the details of a case.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.360
I'm here today…

00:59:10.694 --> 00:59:14.323
to expose the ugly truth
behind the political and business circles.

00:59:16.742 --> 00:59:18.160
This case traces back seven years,

00:59:19.495 --> 00:59:22.831
to the death of an assemblyman's aide.

01:00:03.497 --> 01:00:05.707
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.420
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

01:00:09.503 --> 01:00:11.422
Let's take him down.

01:00:11.505 --> 01:00:12.339
Together.

01:00:12.423 --> 01:00:13.465
Damn it!

01:00:14.508 --> 01:00:16.135
I take it you need cash quickly.

01:00:16.218 --> 01:00:17.302
Yes, I guess so.

01:00:17.886 --> 01:00:19.680
-Here you go.
-He's selling off his building and car

01:00:19.763 --> 01:00:21.932
to pay the penalties
for breaking his ad contracts.

01:00:22.015 --> 01:00:23.350
If I let things go on like this,

01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:26.895
everyone will assume all the rumors
about Mr. Lim are true.

01:00:26.979 --> 01:00:28.397
I'll go.

01:00:28.897 --> 01:00:31.358
What if I begged you not to go?

01:00:31.442 --> 01:00:33.068
Would you still leave?

01:00:34.111 --> 01:00:34.945
Yes.

01:00:39.783 --> 01:00:41.785
