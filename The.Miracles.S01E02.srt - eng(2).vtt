00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.500
How did you know we were here?

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:13.739
I wasn't fair before.

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:16.340
This job...

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.980
...isn't as simple as I thought.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.099
I'm sorry.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.420
Darn it, "sorry" isn't enough.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.540
Get out.

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.260
I want to join you.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.500
You still want to join us?

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:33.980
You're not short on cash, just here to travel.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.579
That's your own business.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.379
But you can't ruin our livelihood.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:38.579
Get out of here!

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.620
Sis...

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.859
Calm down, don't be angry.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:43.659
Sis Fan, Sis Fan, come on, come on.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:44.379
Come on.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.420
Well...

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:47.780
H-How about...

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.140
...you go ask Old Li's family?

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.859
You dare mention Old Li?

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:53.500
This building's...

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.459
...daily revenue...

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.819
...was cut in half by her.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.379
Old Li would be lucky not to cut her!

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.939
You, get out!

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.939
Calm down, come on.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.180
This coffee is quite expensive.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.780
You hit a rough patch and didn't say a word.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.580
You even sent me a red envelope.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.259
You're broke as a joke.

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.300
There's a lot of work.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.099
Go home.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:02.659
The scolding I got today...

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.139
...is more than in my whole life.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.099
Use this person with caution.

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.259
I broke the rules, engaged in unfair competition.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:14.340
Lost eight hundred.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.699
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.780
Why did you all come here?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.780
I... I came to Shenzhen...

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.500
...in the year 2000.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.539
I was here...

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.860
...cooking for people...

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.139
...then delivering it.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:33.699
I watched with my own eyes...

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.939
...as one little stall after another...

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.539
...became a listed company.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:37.699
They bought buildings...

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.539
...set up their own cafeterias, didn't need me anymore.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.620
But you know...

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.099
...why I didn't leave?

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.259
Why?

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:46.699
Who?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.979
Anyone who wants to work can work.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.539
No one bosses you around.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.500
No need to clock in.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:52.699
As long as you're willing to work...

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:53.979
...there's work you can do.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.219
Well, wasn't it just a few years ago...

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.699
...my husband broke his leg delivering goods?

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:00.979
My daughter...

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.060
...was still in middle school.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:03.780
Every day before eleven...

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.139
...I would definitely...

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.979
...buy groceries for the employer's family...

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.860
...and cook the meal.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.259
Then I'd come here to run the buildings.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.659
In the evening...

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:11.659
...I'd go to clients' homes...

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:12.699
...to clean for them.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.060
I make house calls...

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.539
...to walk dogs, feed cats.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:17.540
Sis...

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.740
Every hurdle is hard...

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.339
...but every hurdle can be passed.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:26.259
Sis Fan...

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.660
Who doesn't have hard times?

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.459
When my shop went under back then...

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.540
...I thought I was done for.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.939
Crying to heaven, no answer; crying to earth, no help.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:38.819
But look at me now...

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.420
...aren't I living just fine?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.379
Robert Lucas said...

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.060
...the best way to predict the future...

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:48.339
...is to create it!

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.819
Robert Lucas said...

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.740
...the best way to predict the future...

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.339
...is to create it.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.379
My son's troubles, I can't manage.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.180
My own troubles...

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.939
...I'll get through myself.

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:09.939
To hardships.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.540
And also to those who scolded me.

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:17.819
Cheers, cheers! To all of you who scolded me...

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.420
...enjoy your meal!

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.860
Handsome, your delivery is here.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.899
I'm the handsome one?

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.500
Sorry about that.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.019
That's hilarious.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.660
Hello.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.660
Your delivery is here.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.220
Teacher.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:47.939
Your delivery is here.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.699
You ordered...

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.660
...beef brisket with sliced beef.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:52.220
Pretty lady.

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:53.779
Your delivery is here.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.339
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:59.740
Hold on a sec.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.540
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.740
Whoever grabs it, gets it!

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.660
Paid!

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:06.699
Seg, Seg!

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.139
I have a different opinion.

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:38.379
You wrote all this?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.620
1008.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.220
How to get to Shengang Circuit Board Manufacturing?

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.819
East Gate spiral staircase.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.699
East Gate spiral staircase leads into the heart.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.939
Gate opens, turn right, head to Zone B.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.699
Cross the hall, find the stairs, go to the tenth floor.

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:56.579
Gangshen Circuit hides within.

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:58.579
Behind the glass wall, chips flicker.

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.819
At the corner, a wide yellow light sign.

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.540
Three steps, meet a fork, don't hesitate.

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.459
Hug the wall, go straight, don't turn.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.459
Dark blue doorplate with silver letters.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:09.819
1008 appears before your eyes.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:11.259
Good, impressive.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.540
That floor is a security layer.

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:22.620
You hug the wall and go straight.

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:23.540
Can you get through?

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:25.939
You can't, but I can.

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:31.939
Why do you want to join us?

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:35.180
I want to overcome my difficulties.

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:43.139
Welcome.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.339
Join us.

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:46.379
Okay.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.579
That's really great.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.699
Add her to the group chat.

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:49.259
Okay, Sis.

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:50.259
I'll add you to the group right now.

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:52.819
Sis, let's add each other on WeChat.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.339
Otherwise...

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:54.819
...stop pretending.

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:57.139
I've been listening at the door for two days.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.300
It's all because you're here.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.259
tipping her off.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:00.339
The secret's out.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.939
Add one more. Add one more.

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:02.980
Add it again.

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:05.259
At least...

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.699
You look like a floor runner now.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:13.860
9B27.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:14.980
Thanks.

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:16.699
My pleasure.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.740
Hey, driver.

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:32.980
Where are you?

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.019
Why are you getting farther away?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.220
Gave it to the floor runner.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:36.899
It's a woman.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:40.940
Sis Fan.

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:44.059
There's a rush order on the 18th floor, Tower C.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.019
Can you...

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:46.539
9B30.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.059
Hello, your delivery.

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:54.700
Enjoy your meal.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.460
Thank you, thank you.

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:57.299
Got it, got it.

00:08:57.419 --> 00:08:58.820
Alright, thanks.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.340
It's my son.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.940
Working for someone to pay off debts.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.179
Doesn't want me to know.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.740
Thank you.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.379
You're welcome.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.379
This typhoon...

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:29.779
is the largest in five years.

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:31.740
The meteorological department kindly reminds everyone:

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:33.019
Factories and schools...

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:34.379
should schedule time in advance.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.980
Please prepare daily necessities ahead of time.

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:38.059
Minimize going out.

00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:48.620
I've made several trips already.

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:49.500
Still so many left.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:53.259
Let me rearrange things.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.659
These areas all go to Lao Zhou.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:56.500
Deliver to the office.

00:09:56.539 --> 00:09:56.940
Okay.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.500
These...

00:09:57.899 --> 00:09:58.779
Sister Xiang, they're yours.

00:09:58.899 --> 00:09:59.539
No problem.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.980
But these...

00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:03.779
that the elevator can't reach directly...

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.779
I'll take them.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:06.539
You...

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:07.659
Can you handle it?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.779
I can hold off a million soldiers with one sword.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.539
Sister Xiang, Sister Xiang, heads up.

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.139
I heard this afternoon that Aisle A12...

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:29.220
Boss Li will be stocking goods.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.539
There might be a blockage.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.259
Got it.

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:32.820
Put them in the counter area in the east zone first.

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:34.059
Enjoy your meal.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.259
Enjoy your meal, sis.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.299
Lao Zhou.

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:40.220
That delivery table of yours is broken.

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:41.419
Be careful not to knock it over.

00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:43.740
Sis Fan.

00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:45.179
Are you still okay?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.259
No problem.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.500
Hang in there.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:49.779
Sister Xiang, Sister Xiang!

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.899
5314B.

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:52.740
The shop's delivery is about to be late.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.940
Hurry up and get it over there.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:55.980
Sis Fan.

00:10:56.659 --> 00:10:57.659
You call me Sister Xiang.

00:10:58.299 --> 00:10:59.259
Then do you know my surname?

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:01.259
What is it, Sister Xiang?

00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:02.620
My surname is Liu.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.740
Enjoy your meal.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.139
Sis Fan.

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:28.059
How are you holding up?

00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:29.740
I have just one last order here.

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.019
The last order in your hand...

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:32.299
seems to be from a new shop.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.059
It's the Tuoxin Electronics order.

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:34.740
No problem.

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:36.860
Where is it? I'll help deliver it.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.659
Tuoxin Electronics yesterday...

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.419
had me make an electronic QR code for them.

00:11:39.659 --> 00:11:41.139
They ordered the Supreme Edition.

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:42.539
What does 'Supreme' mean?

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:43.259
Bottom right corner, bottom right.

00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:44.340
Press that electric button.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.259
Hurry, press it.

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:46.820
Let me show you...

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:49.019
the power of the previous era.

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:50.860
Follow the light strip straight ahead.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.899
Walk to the end and you'll find their place.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:11:59.980
Awesome.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.139
Hey, handsome, your delivery is here.

00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:12.779
It's fine, it'll be okay in a moment.

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:16.259
Great!

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:18.379
Fantastic, Lao Zhou.

00:12:28.299 --> 00:12:28.860
Sis.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.940
One order was left behind.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.620
There are five minutes left.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.860
It's about to be late.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.299
Darn it.

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:34.299
I'll still go.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.779
It's for the VIP floor.

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:55.139
I guessed you'd come this way.

00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:56.659
You told me.

00:12:58.659 --> 00:12:59.299
Rheumatism...

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:02.500
should rest.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.779
But who in this building...

00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:05.379
dares to rest?

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:06.860
Give it to me.

00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:08.299
No way.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.820
This is the VIP floor.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.500
Wait here.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.259
Hello?

00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:19.539
No, I'm really hungry.

00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:21.059
No, I mean *very* hungry.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.340
Not very hot.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.100
Of course, I am also very hot.

00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:25.299
Let me tell you.

00:13:25.299 --> 00:13:26.820
I'm right at the elevator now.

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:27.980
If you don't bring it to me soon...

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.980
I'll file a complaint against you.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.860
Sorry for the long wait.

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:45.779
Five minutes late.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:47.139
I can refund your order.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:48.059
Please don't complain about the delivery person.

00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:49.299
I won't complain.

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:50.700
Sis.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.700
We've met before.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.980
Last time you delivered the wrong order.

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:54.179
Bald Qiang...

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:55.220
Electronics Technology Co., Ltd.

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:55.940
Yuanxin.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.139
Yes, yes, yes.

00:13:57.899 --> 00:13:58.700
It's still you.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.379
Let me tell you, sis.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:00.659
Not only will I not complain about you...

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:01.500
I have to thank you.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.860
On our entire floor...

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.220
I was the only one who got lunch delivered.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.659
Alright, then I'll go back and eat.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.500
Thank you, sis.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.379
Enjoy your meal.

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:17.299
The rain has finally stopped.

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:25.620
You used to be an opera singer.

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:27.299
A martial female role.

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:29.700
Is that role very impressive?

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:31.139
Depends on who's performing it.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.379
When I perform it, it's impressive.

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:36.539
You used to work here.

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:39.379
I used to run a company here.

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:41.259
Now you're hustling in this building.

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:43.059
Everyone

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:45.379
has their own difficulties.

00:14:45.539 --> 00:14:46.659
Even hustling, you're a leader.

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.259
Only you can get into the VIP floors.

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:50.220
Do you know

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:51.779
why I asked you to join?

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:54.100
Please, tell me.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.299
My former company was in unit 5409.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.580
Even though I'm hustling now,

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:01.779
one day

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:02.980
I will definitely get back to

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:04.340
running my own company.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.899
I'll rent that unit again.

00:15:06.299 --> 00:15:07.100
I don't know

00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:08.179
how you knew that,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.340
but I'm still very grateful to you

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.980
for cleaning unit 5409 for me.

00:15:20.299 --> 00:15:21.379
Cleaning 5409?

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.860
That 5409

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.740
is my son's company.

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:24.899
I was cleaning the windows for my son's company.

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:26.259
Your son's company?

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:26.980
Stop pretending.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.139
That was my company.

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:29.379
My son is also facing difficulties.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.659
He owes people money.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.659
I... No...

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:32.659
Wait a second, let me make a call.

00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:33.139
Hold on.

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:34.139
What you're saying...

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:35.860
to my son...

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.259
Hello? Hello? Xinpeng?

00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:39.740
Your company...

00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:41.059
Your shop...

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:43.259
Is it in unit 5409 at Saige Plaza?

00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:45.059
No, it's not.

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:46.580
Mine is 9B30.

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:48.620
But your shop is called Xinpeng Electronics

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.539
Technology Co., Ltd., right?

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.179
Yes.

00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:52.179
But mine uses the "new" character for "Xin".

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:54.059
Because I found the original name

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:55.500
seemed to be already registered.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.779
So I changed it a bit.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.860
So that day when you were hesitant,

00:15:57.899 --> 00:15:58.500
then said it was nothing...

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.899
I thought something was wrong!

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.019
Well, that...

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.340
Mom...

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:05.100
Let me be honest with you.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.860
I've started seeing someone.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.340
Mom?

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:10.299
What's wrong?

00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:12.139
Nothing's wrong.

00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:15.379
I'm doing just fine.

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.379
I have a new job.

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:20.139
You found another job?

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:20.860
I'll return your...

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.019
My "happy retirement" red envelope...

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:22.659
I'll give it back to you.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.419
Gotta go.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:25.700
This...

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.460
Sister Wang...

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:30.740
Why is your company called Xinpeng?

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:33.179
My name is Wang Xinpeng.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.379
Incredible.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.299
Saige Plaza! Two yuan per order!

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.940
Two yuan per order!

00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:07.180
Saige! Two yuan per order!

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.700
Come on, come on!

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.380
Scan the code! Scan it!

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:10.259
Scan! Scan! Scan!

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:10.740
Saige Plaza! Two yuan per order!

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:11.579
Two yuan per order!

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:12.380
Alright! Alright!

00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:13.380
Come on, come on!

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.059
Here! Here! Here!

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:14.660
Come on, come on!

00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:19.339
Cut!

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.140
No one called "cut"!
