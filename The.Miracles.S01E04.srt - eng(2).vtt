Brother Zhang

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.480
Don't work during your break.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.799
Dance.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.079
You won't complete the task.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.719
How can you face

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:10.519
your fellow villagers?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.959
Look, Brother.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.239
Your heart is just too full.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.159
When your heart is full,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.560
just like this tea,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.879
it... it overflows.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:23.480
Here,

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:25.239
there's a saying.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.879
The wind

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.280
will carry your worries away.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:30.920
The snow

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.480
will cleanse your soul.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.519
Then the path

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.359
will naturally

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.200
come to you.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.000
Don't have too much pressure.

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:42.480
Don't overthink it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.680
Right.

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.079
You need a balance of work and rest.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.599
Brother Zhang,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.640
let's go dance with the villagers.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.280
You guys go. I won't go.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.959
Let's go.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.480
Brother Zhang.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.480
Look, isn't it beautiful?

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.120
Grandma Zhuoma asked me

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.159
to give this to you.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.800
Why are you so late?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.199
It gets dark late here.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.800
Look at my Tibetan robe.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.280
How is it?

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.039
Grandma Zhuoma gave it to me.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.000
Hurry and get Niuniu to come over.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.759
Let her see it too.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.080
She's been asleep for a long time.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.240
I came back from overtime today,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.360
and it was already late.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.319
She waited all evening

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.639
and still didn't get your call.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.240
Day after day,

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.400
she's been so upset.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:48.960
I'm sorry.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.879
I got busy and forgot.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.039
Earthquake!

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.560
Be careful!

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.240
Don't run around!

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.240
What's happening over there?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.080
Earthquake!

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.360
Zhaoyuan!

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.400
These yaks

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.039
were all raised by Grandma Zhuoma

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.800
since they were calves.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.280
The bond is very deep.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.840
I've already helped her

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.120
submit the claim information.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.240
It can't ease her sorrow,

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.120
but at least

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.319
it can reduce her loss.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:34.520
It shows here

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.439
six yaks haven't returned yet.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.080
They might have been too scared

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.759
and ran far away.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.439
We'll go later

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.039
to find them and bring them back.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.919
Okay, okay.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.159
My Niuniu is missing.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.919
I don't know where it went.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.400
She says Niuniu can't be found.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.120
Grandma.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.280
It doesn't have an ear tag.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.120
On this,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.960
we can't see its location.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800
Grandma, it doesn't have an ear tag.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:56.400
On this,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.039
we can't see its location.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.240
Then... then maybe

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.520
it ran to that mountain over there

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.800
to graze.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.639
The grass there is good.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.080
Niuniu might have gone there.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.039
Niuniu likes to eat the grass there.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.759
Using the ear tags,

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.240
we've already found four yaks.

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.360
We'll come help you after finding one more.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.680
You must head back before dark.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.639
It's too cold at night; you could freeze to death.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.240
I know.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.680
But there's nothing here but mountains.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680
There's nothing at all.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.560
Where am I supposed to look for it?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.319
Yak dung on the grassland is a trail marker.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.160
If there's fresh dung,

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.160
it might have been left by Niuniu.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.319
Lao Mou!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.680
Where's Haza?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.959
Why isn't he answering his phone?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.439
They found a yak.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.160
It's a bit injured.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680
They all went to carry the yak.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680
Probably can't free up their hands.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.839
How are things on your end?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.839
He told me to look for yak dung.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:54.519
I found some.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.519
But I don't see Niuniu.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.519
I'm not sure now

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:59.759
if this dung is from Niuniu.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.000
You... do this.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.199
Touch it.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.480
I... I have to touch it?

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.439
You... you touch it.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600
If it's still warm,

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:10.959
then it could be Niuniu's.

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.360
What if it's not warm?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.040
That depends on how not warm it is.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.439
I really have to touch it?

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:17.959
What else are you gonna do if you don't touch it?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.120
You could taste it instead.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.040
Fine, got it.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.360
Hello?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.800
Then... then

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.360
you can't taste it!

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.040
Damn it.

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:57.319
Why is it out of gas now?

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.199
Haza!

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.120
Haza!

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.800
Have you found my Niuniu?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.480
No.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.480
Didn't all the other yaks come back?

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:09.560
Grandma Zhuoma,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.720
Niuniu doesn't have an ear tag.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.360
The other yaks all have ear tags.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.199
So their location shows up on this.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.160
That's how we found them.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.600
It's all my fault.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:20.040
I didn't listen to you.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.480
Now Niuniu is suffering instead.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.279
Grandma Zhuoma,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.519
don't worry.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.079
You have to believe in Brother Zhang.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.839
He's a man of great capability.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.959
He will definitely find it.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.800
Yes, yes, don't worry.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.920
Go home and rest, rest.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.360
Let's go.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:34.120
Go.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.839
Finally found you.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:49.240
Niu Niu.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.120
Don't run. Don't run, don't run, don't run.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.040
Grandma Zhuoma misses you.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.360
I'm looking for you on her behalf.

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.800
Niu Niu.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.120
What's wrong, Niu Niu?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.519
Niu Niu.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.920
You're hurt.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.000
Don't be afraid.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.399
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.839
Don't be afraid.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.319
Grandma Zhuoma is looking for you.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.959
Don't be afraid.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:22.480
Are you injured?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.800
Let me see.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.959
Let me see.

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.240
Stay still, okay?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.279
Don't move.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:34.920
No signal.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:37.800
Niu Niu.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800
Can you still walk?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.839
Can you stand up, Niu Niu?

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.560
The rescue convoy has set off.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.720
We'll head out first.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.439
Sis, don't cry. Don't worry.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.720
We will definitely find Brother Zhang.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.560
Lao Mou, ready yet?

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.600
Ready. Let's go.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:00.720
Haza.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.160
Haza.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.680
Here.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.839
Take these flatbreads.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.079
Zhang likes the flatbreads I make.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.759
Give them to him. He must be hungry.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.279
Grandma, wait for us.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.680
We will definitely find Niu Niu.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.519
Okay.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.600
Be careful.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.680
We're off. Goodbye.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.040
Okay.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.240
Stop groaning.

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:23.600
I know it hurts.

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:25.920
Look at you.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.920
How did you manage to break your leg?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.920
If you'd gotten the ear tag earlier,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.759
this wouldn't have happened.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.240
You silly Niu Niu.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.600
So beautiful.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.080
If Niu Niu and her mom

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.120
could be here, that would be great.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.039
Today, because I was looking for you,

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.519
I couldn't call Niu Niu again.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.399
She must be very sad.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.360
Last time on her birthday, she made a wish.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.279
She said she hoped her dad was a great hero,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.399
to protect her,

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.480
protect her mom,

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.159
and protect the whole world.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.240
Tell me,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.519
have I let them down?

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:33.559
Why are you looking at me?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.360
Alright.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.279
I know that's what you're thinking.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.919
The rescue vehicle...

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:52.240
I don't know when it will arrive.

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:53.600
What I'm most worried about now

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.679
is him getting hypothermic from the cold.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I plan to use the drone

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.039
to search for him first.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.159
Understood?

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.440
How's it going, Lao Mou?

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:02.399
I'll go contact rescue.

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:04.000
You operate the drone to search for him.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.240
I'll operate this.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.399
Then you go contact rescue.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.679
Then I'm even less capable.

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.919
You're fine with the drone.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.080
You have to believe in yourself.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:11.399
Right. I need to save him.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.200
Believe me, bro.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.919
Uncle, wake up!

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.279
There's danger!

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.039
Wake up! Wake up!

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:21.559
What's wrong, Niu Niu?

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:27.799
Niu Niu, don't be afraid.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.399
Don't you be afraid.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.919
Don't you move.

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:34.039
Don't move. Don't move.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.559
I know.

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.080
I... I know you're hungry.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.679
But... but it can't die today.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:10:59.080
And I can't die either.

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:03.039
Don't come any closer.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.679
Come on!

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.600
Brother Zhang!

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:00.519
Brother Zhang!

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.480
You... wake up! Wake up!

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.399
You can't sleep! You can't sleep!

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:11.879
Don't forget, you promised me

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.799
you'd take me flying.

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:15.759
Wake up!

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.279
Can't sleep.

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:23.039
Can you hear me?

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.240
We're here!

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:36.039
We're here!

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.799
Niu Niu! Niu Niu!

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.840
They've come to find us!

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:44.919
They're here!

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:47.639
Niu Niu! Niu Niu!

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.080
Are you okay?

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.159
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm fine!

00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:55.360
You... you held on.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.200
You held on.

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:57.279
That rescue convoy

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.440
will be here any minute.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.559
Niu Niu.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.120
Look.

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:32.840
This is the friend

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.200
Daddy wanted to introduce you to.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.240
Niu Niu.

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:36.679
Niu Niu.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.480
Hello, I'm Niu Niu.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.200
You're so cute.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.279
Are you coming to Shenzhen to play?

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.720
I'll take you to eat yummy food.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.600
How come you've lost weight?

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:52.519
I'm good! I'm good!

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.559
No worries lately.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.960
Eating well, sleeping soundly.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:58.440
Haza.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.519
Haza.

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:02.480
Quick, call Zhang to come eat meat.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:02.960
Okay, okay, okay.

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:05.759
Brother Zhang!

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.559
Come eat mutton!

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.279
Coming!

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.759
Grandma Zhuoma, please.

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.320
Good, good.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.120
Good, good.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:15.759
Niu Niu.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.480
I'll take you and Mom

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.759
to see the happy life

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.360
of the Tibetan people.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:19.919
Let's go.

00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:21.440
Off we go!

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.080
Alright.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.600
This is my story.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.279
You must be curious,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.360
did I create a miracle,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.480
and win the Quarterly Star award?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.960
That's not important at all.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.120
Haza got the drone he bought with the bonus,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.480
and smiled like a child.

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:52.720
Old Mou also got his wish,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.480
staying in beautiful Xizang.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.000
The so-called miracle is never in the reports.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.080
It's in Grandma Zhuoma's

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.480
smile lines when she laughs.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.120
In the warmth of Niu Niu nuzzling my palm.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.559
In this wind, half carrying longing,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:07.720
half

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.840
plunging into the grassland.
