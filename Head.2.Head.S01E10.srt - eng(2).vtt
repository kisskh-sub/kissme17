00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:14.921
Two years after Auntie Jan’s death…

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:16.985
You’ll disappear for seven years.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.039
We’ll meet again when we’re 30.

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:23.470
You’re not like this because of me, are you?

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:25.041
I love you.

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:26.597
Do you love me?

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:27.762
I’ve always loved you.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.773
Since we were seven.

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:31.215
Let go of Van’s arm already.

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:33.646
I’ve been clinging to him for years.

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:34.905
He’s my boyfriend now.

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:35.938
Farm!

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:38.092
Don’t joke like that.

00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:40.542
I f*cking regret

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:43.555
gambling our friendship on this shit.

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:46.303
If you choose him, then you don’t need me.

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:47.286
Jinn!

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:48.267
Jinn, son!

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:57.819
J.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:00.489
Did you hear some noise?

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:02.099
J?

00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:11.428
Shit, J!

00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:13.865
J!

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:15.609
What the hell are you doing?

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:16.762
You almost fell.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:20.851
J!

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:24.049
Is this really you?

00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:26.827
Is this real or a dream?

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:28.617
I don’t know anymore, Jinn.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:30.692
I don’t know.

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:34.671
I don’t know…

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.193
J, take it easy.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.495
Are you really okay?

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.476
I’m okay, J.

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:50.623
It was just a dream.

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:53.643
I’m right here.

00:01:58.491 --> 00:01:59.552
Promise me

00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:01.893
you’ll be okay.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:04.994
I promise.

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:08.228
I promise I’ll be fine.

00:03:58.131 --> 00:03:59.995
I’m so not used to seeing you like this.

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:01.749
Me neither.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.552
Suddenly, alcohol doesn’t taste as good.

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:10.952
Hey, about you and Farm,
are you really dating?

00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:14.563
Yeah.

00:04:15.134 --> 00:04:16.473
I asked him to be my boyfriend.

00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:18.893
And then?

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.507
You can see how good he is to me.

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:24.127
Especially after we became roommates.

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:26.086
He takes really good care of me.

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:29.934
And I’ve known for a while that

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.100
he doesn’t see me as just a friend.

00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:34.542
So he treats you well,

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:36.427
and that made you like him. Is that it?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.928
I’m not sure.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:47.321
You’re not sure, yet you’re the one
who asked him to be your boyfriend?

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.736
What is this? I don’t get it.

00:04:51.854 --> 00:04:53.321
I don’t want to lose him to anyone.

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:56.424
Are you saying that—

00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:57.205
He likes me,

00:04:57.816 --> 00:04:59.144
and I feel comfortable being with him.

00:04:59.898 --> 00:05:00.966
Isn’t that enough?

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.725
But aren’t people in a relationship

00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:06.017
supposed to love each other?

00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:12.029
Van, you prick.

00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:15.264
It’s Farm’s feelings we’re talking about here.

00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:18.087
You’re treating him like he’s a toy.

00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:20.501
You know I have no one in my life.

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.634
He came in and became my new home.

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.370
Being with him makes me feel so warm.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.544
He feels like real family.

00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:33.127
So you’re using a boyfriend label
to keep him tied to you.

00:05:33.738 --> 00:05:38.132
Do you really not see how selfish that is?

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:42.257
I…

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:44.592
I thought I’d grow to love him someday.

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:46.058
Van, you asshole.

00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:49.525
Why are you so angry?

00:05:51.582 --> 00:05:53.212
Because your logic is messed up.

00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:54.007
Mai.

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:58.074
You knew all too well he liked you,

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.210
and you still did this to him.

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.680
You don’t get to use your loneliness
as an excuse to do something wrong.

00:06:08.687 --> 00:06:11.297
That excuse doesn’t even make sense.

00:06:11.297 --> 00:06:13.033
Hey, don’t you think that’s too harsh?

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:16.584
All the crap you pulled with your exes,
all we could do was lecture you.

00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:18.340
But this is Farm.

00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:20.857
You shouldn’t have done it.

00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:25.440
And I’m telling you this straight.

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:30.007
Someone like Farm wouldn’t have left you,
even if you didn’t pull this shit.

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:31.681
But you did this anyway.

00:06:32.822 --> 00:06:34.100
Now you’re gonna lose him for real.

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:10.686
Why are you not sleeping?

00:07:12.662 --> 00:07:14.956
You have a fever. Your body’s burning up.

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:23.925
I’ll do my best to end everything.

00:07:24.353 --> 00:07:25.522
Just wait for me.

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:29.366
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:34.609
But I believe you can handle it.

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.991
Did you call to yell at me again, Mai?

00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:25.904
(I’m sorry. I lost my temper earlier.)

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.759
(Where are you? I’ll come get you.)

00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:28.794
No need.

00:08:28.957 --> 00:08:30.583
(Not the time to sulk.)

00:08:30.848 --> 00:08:33.026
(If you’re not staying with me,
where are you crashing tonight?)

00:08:34.248 --> 00:08:37.147
I’m not sulking. I’m at Farm’s.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.587
(Are you out of your mind?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.367
You’re going to get kicked out.)

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:44.190
(You know how Farm gets when he’s angry.)

00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:45.609
He won’t do that to me.

00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:48.239
(Are you gonna exploit his kind heart again?)

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.657
(Don’t even think about it, jerk.)

00:08:49.983 --> 00:08:51.635
Yeah, I know.

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:52.877
I’ve realized how shitty my actions were.

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.679
I came here to apologize

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.163
and tell him the truth.

00:08:57.489 --> 00:08:59.015
(You came to your senses too easily.)

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:01.889
Mai, you dipshit. What do you want from me?

00:09:02.256 --> 00:09:04.634
(Fine. It’s good that you’ve reflected.)

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.720
(Leave Farm out of this.)

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.862
(He can’t handle heartbreak. You know that.)

00:09:11.023 --> 00:09:11.804
Yeah.

00:09:12.456 --> 00:09:14.397
Thanks for
knocking some sense into me.

00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:16.623
(Call me anytime.)

00:09:31.385 --> 00:09:32.850
PATCH THINGS UP WITH HIM.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.788
TELL HIM YOURSELF.

00:09:34.788 --> 00:09:36.490
IT’S BETTER THAN LETTING HIM
HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:38.212
HE’S SO DAMN IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:09:38.395 --> 00:09:42.664
IMAGINE HOW BROKEN HE’LL BE
IF HE FINDS OUT YOU’VE BEEN PLAYING WITH HIS FEELINGS.

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:44.840
IF YOU DON’T LOVE HIM, SAY IT.

00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:47.984
IT’LL HURT LESS THAN
PRETENDING YOU DO.

00:09:48.127 --> 00:09:50.090
I’M HERE FOR YOU, MAN.
JUST ONE CALL AWAY.

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:55.063
THANKS, DUDE.

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:19.188
Can you stop smoking?

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.098
I need to talk to you.

00:10:21.953 --> 00:10:24.251
When I said I wanted our love to work out,

00:10:24.638 --> 00:10:26.110
how did you feel after hearing it?

00:10:28.188 --> 00:10:29.065
Farm.

00:10:37.878 --> 00:10:39.222
Did you go through my phone?

00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:42.562
Am I a freaking joke to you?

00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:45.909
You guys are so damn good.

00:10:46.092 --> 00:10:47.422
How did you manage not to laugh?

00:10:48.176 --> 00:10:49.601
It’s not like that.

00:10:49.601 --> 00:10:52.567
I’m a complete moron
for falling for an asshole like you.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.117
F*ck.

00:11:24.007 --> 00:11:25.964
I’m sorry. Did I wake you?

00:11:28.775 --> 00:11:31.058
I didn’t hear the alarm.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.271
It hasn’t gone off yet.

00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:40.541
We still have half an hour.

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:43.554
Come up and sleep on the bed.

00:11:56.438 --> 00:11:58.020
Let go of my arm, maybe?

00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:00.364
No.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.088
Why not?

00:12:03.636 --> 00:12:05.296
I’m afraid it’ll be like last night.

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:08.722
Are you worried about me?

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:11.207
Mm.

00:12:25.686 --> 00:12:26.609
Do you love me?

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:28.503
Mm…

00:12:29.358 --> 00:12:30.051
What was that?

00:12:30.682 --> 00:12:31.864
Yes.

00:12:32.513 --> 00:12:33.364
You love who?

00:12:34.423 --> 00:12:35.679
I love you.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:37.558
Who?

00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:41.579
I love you, J.

00:12:57.327 --> 00:12:58.973
Come with us, new friend.

00:12:58.973 --> 00:13:01.528
Is this the exact spot
where we became friends?

00:13:01.528 --> 00:13:02.823
J, you’re dead!

00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:04.375
You, move!

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:04.875
Let go of my hair.

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:05.567
Stop!

00:13:05.927 --> 00:13:07.008
Who the hell are you guys?

00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:32.395
Will you stop watching it? Are you nuts?

00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:33.706
No.

00:13:35.442 --> 00:13:36.351
Hey!

00:13:36.808 --> 00:13:37.760
Don’t.

00:13:38.604 --> 00:13:39.625
You’re cute here.

00:13:41.392 --> 00:13:42.003
J!

00:13:45.196 --> 00:13:45.696
J.

00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:47.647
Hey.

00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:50.735
Mai, what’s wrong with you?

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:51.438
Guys!

00:13:51.438 --> 00:13:52.022
What?

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.588
We’ve got a huge problem.

00:13:56.808 --> 00:13:58.640
You know we’re
the only safe place Farm has.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.676
It wasn’t easy for him
to open up to us like this.

00:14:03.558 --> 00:14:05.508
Yell at me all you want.

00:14:05.897 --> 00:14:07.691
I’ll take it. This is all on me.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.200
What are you going to do now?

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:17.643
Farm.

00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:29.067
If you’re not comfortable
with me in the group,

00:14:29.456 --> 00:14:30.763
I can leave.

00:14:31.694 --> 00:14:32.906
You can come back and join them.

00:14:35.032 --> 00:14:35.958
Stay the hell out of my business.

00:14:49.247 --> 00:14:51.914
I think this is harder than we thought.

00:14:56.327 --> 00:14:57.318
I’ll take it from here.

00:15:22.687 --> 00:15:26.055
I kind of miss this place somehow.

00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:35.997
Is this the exact spot
where we became friends?

00:15:37.648 --> 00:15:39.326
Jinn, this is the library.

00:15:40.803 --> 00:15:41.596
I don’t care.

00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:45.839
I’ll chase you to hell if that means
I can draw every drop of blood out of you.

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:46.862
You’re so dead, J!

00:15:47.365 --> 00:15:47.880
Hey.

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:49.634
You, move!

00:15:49.634 --> 00:15:50.372
Calm down.

00:15:51.005 --> 00:15:51.505
Hey!

00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:52.921
Would you calm down?

00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:53.756
Jinn, let go of my hair.

00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:54.774
Stop! Stop!

00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:56.875
Who the hell are you guys?

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:03.809
You two are the reason I ended up on
the library’s blacklist for the entire semester

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.884
for causing trouble.

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:11.598
Blame Jinn. I didn’t start it.

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:17.176
Come to think of it, I’m quite surprised

00:16:18.036 --> 00:16:22.473
that the disastrous 2Js ended up together.

00:16:23.008 --> 00:16:23.928
Disastrous?

00:16:24.788 --> 00:16:25.325
Yeah.

00:16:28.408 --> 00:16:31.399
And do you remember that?

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:33.460
What?

00:16:36.186 --> 00:16:37.376
Our deal.

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:51.814
So how did it go? Who won this round?

00:16:51.814 --> 00:16:53.949
Oh wow, seriously?

00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:55.051
Who won?

00:16:55.651 --> 00:16:59.171
What were you guys thinking,
fighting in the library?

00:16:59.593 --> 00:17:00.928
He was the one who ran in there.

00:17:01.025 --> 00:17:03.301
You’re the idiot. Don’t pin this on me.

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.959
Where are you going?

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:12.302
We feel bad dragging you into this mess.

00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:15.765
Why don’t you let this asshole
buy you a drink as an apology?

00:17:16.187 --> 00:17:17.255
Why me, you stupid jerk?

00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:18.261
And here we go again.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:19.201
Come on.

00:17:20.483 --> 00:17:22.262
Come with us, new friend.

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:33.367
Yeah.

00:17:34.405 --> 00:17:34.905
Let’s go.

00:17:36.219 --> 00:17:36.719
Let’s go.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.141
The old friends should tag along too.

00:17:48.136 --> 00:17:49.178
What’s with you?

00:17:49.178 --> 00:17:49.848
Why do you keep nudging me?

00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:51.273
Look at his last name.

00:17:51.273 --> 00:17:53.486
Catch the last train… what?

00:17:53.486 --> 00:17:56.646
Not the last train. I said his last name.

00:17:58.187 --> 00:17:58.995
Holy shit!

00:18:00.618 --> 00:18:02.315
Why do you have the same last name
as the owner of this university?

00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:02.815
What?

00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:04.793
Seriously?

00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:08.656
I’m just a distant relative.

00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:12.087
A distant relative?

00:18:12.395 --> 00:18:13.642
So what are you, then?

00:18:13.642 --> 00:18:16.767
A hotel heir? A mall owner? A politician?

00:18:16.994 --> 00:18:18.910
What are you even talking about, Mai?

00:18:19.088 --> 00:18:20.517
Well, look at his last name.

00:18:20.842 --> 00:18:24.501
It’s one of the top five
wealthiest families in the country.

00:18:24.501 --> 00:18:26.849
Damn.

00:18:28.244 --> 00:18:28.977
Will you excuse me?

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:30.265
Hey, hey!

00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:44.906
I’m not as rich as you guys think.

00:18:45.036 --> 00:18:48.377
I’m just a distant relative who
happens to share the same last name.

00:18:50.308 --> 00:18:51.700
Just leave me alone.

00:18:53.177 --> 00:18:54.683
I’m not who you think I am.

00:18:57.555 --> 00:18:59.313
What have you been through, huh?

00:19:00.157 --> 00:19:01.893
Why are your walls so high?

00:19:02.526 --> 00:19:04.803
But that’s fine. I’m a really good climber.

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:05.856
Eiei.

00:19:07.917 --> 00:19:08.642
Alright.

00:19:09.534 --> 00:19:13.001
I’m sorry about my friend for being nosy
and digging into your background.

00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:15.658
I’m sorry, sir.

00:19:17.183 --> 00:19:18.717
And as an apology,

00:19:19.528 --> 00:19:22.702
I officially allow you to join our friend group.

00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:24.104
Yay!

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:30.666
Yay! Come on. Say it.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:33.961
How is that an apology, dumbass?

00:19:34.188 --> 00:19:36.318
Did you even ask
if he wants to be friends with us?

00:19:37.778 --> 00:19:39.150
Can I ask you guys one thing?

00:19:40.205 --> 00:19:43.055
I just want to be a normal university student.

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:44.286
Deal.

00:19:45.097 --> 00:19:49.021
As long as you stop
hiding out in the library alone.

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:51.972
You’ve got a group now.

00:19:52.653 --> 00:19:54.266
No need to go solo, right?

00:19:55.434 --> 00:19:56.736
If you’re okay with it,

00:19:58.764 --> 00:19:59.574
I’m okay too.

00:20:01.407 --> 00:20:02.498
So, what do you say, buddy?

00:20:03.893 --> 00:20:04.636
Mm.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.203
- Gosh, my muscles are sore.
- Right.

00:20:10.361 --> 00:20:11.333
What are you guys doing?

00:20:17.297 --> 00:20:18.940
Why did you want to
be friends with me back then?

00:20:23.272 --> 00:20:27.608
Do you want the honest answer,
or the sugarcoated one?

00:20:27.722 --> 00:20:28.764
Don’t be an ass, J.

00:20:29.754 --> 00:20:30.458
I’m just kidding.

00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:36.988
You just seemed lonely. And kind of strange.

00:20:37.994 --> 00:20:38.748
Strange how?

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:46.008
How many rich people try that hard
to hide who they are, as you did?

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.617
Look at your place, your car,

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.696
everything you use.

00:20:51.994 --> 00:20:56.145
If I hadn’t known your last name, I never
would’ve guessed who you really were.

00:20:57.151 --> 00:20:58.409
I don’t want anyone to know.

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:00.973
And I don’t want to be part of that family.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.030
I just want to live a normal life.

00:21:05.971 --> 00:21:06.996
Well, here it is.

00:21:08.489 --> 00:21:10.501
We’re giving you a normal life.

00:21:13.896 --> 00:21:14.523
Yeah.

00:21:16.649 --> 00:21:17.590
Students.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.477
The library will be closing soon.

00:21:22.024 --> 00:21:22.524
Hey.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.321
Same place?

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:27.732
It feels like we’ve had
a lot to think about lately.

00:21:27.732 --> 00:21:29.562
And now Van and Farm are being like this.

00:21:29.562 --> 00:21:30.799
If you’re tired, get some rest.

00:21:31.578 --> 00:21:33.327
Leave the rest with me.

00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:35.903
You’re the one
I should be worried about the most.

00:21:55.989 --> 00:21:58.000
How long has it been
since we were last up here?

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.209
Not that long.

00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:04.745
Ever since you quit.

00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:14.927
I forgot this was where
we used to sneak up to smoke.

00:22:16.027 --> 00:22:19.824
Being here without smoking
actually feels kind of nice.

00:22:23.344 --> 00:22:23.961
J.

00:22:25.521 --> 00:22:26.915
You can go back to him.

00:22:29.895 --> 00:22:30.937
I’m serious.

00:22:33.157 --> 00:22:34.685
I think I handle
being alone better than he does.

00:22:36.265 --> 00:22:36.903
Farm.

00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:42.081
I was the last one to join the group.

00:22:43.681 --> 00:22:45.745
If someone has to leave,

00:22:45.845 --> 00:22:47.259
it should be me, right?

00:22:50.979 --> 00:22:52.181
You are so you.

00:22:53.841 --> 00:22:55.575
Always caring about everything in the world.

00:22:56.215 --> 00:22:57.267
Except yourself.

00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:05.720
Because I know
how much it hurts to feel abandoned.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.363
Answer me honestly.

00:23:12.983 --> 00:23:16.704
Do you think you can go back
to being friends with Van?

00:23:18.444 --> 00:23:20.622
I know I started this.

00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:23.380
If I hadn’t liked him in the first place,

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.247
none of this would’ve happened.

00:23:27.147 --> 00:23:28.314
Don’t put this on yourself.

00:23:30.614 --> 00:23:32.370
I just feel so heartbroken.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.510
My parents don’t love each other.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.490
They stay together for convenience.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.833
They’ve always told me

00:23:42.853 --> 00:23:44.454
true love doesn’t exist.

00:23:46.274 --> 00:23:47.020
But you know what?

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.456
I never believed them.

00:23:53.296 --> 00:23:54.947
I kept hoping that one day

00:23:56.567 --> 00:23:58.302
I’d love someone so deeply,

00:23:59.782 --> 00:24:01.970
and let them know true love does exist.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.414
But what Van did to me was
a slap in the face that woke me up.

00:24:13.534 --> 00:24:16.065
He made me realize
my parents’ words were right after all.

00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:18.501
Maybe true love really doesn’t exist.

00:24:23.408 --> 00:24:24.519
It does.

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:28.153
What you believe in is real.

00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:34.487
I know how much this hurts you,

00:24:35.387 --> 00:24:37.224
but time will help.

00:24:39.783 --> 00:24:41.379
And so will we.

00:24:47.579 --> 00:24:49.917
As for me going back to Van,

00:24:50.977 --> 00:24:53.690
have you forgotten we’re a group of five?

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.178
If you’re not comfortable being around him,

00:25:00.078 --> 00:25:01.468
we’ll take turns staying with you.

00:25:02.288 --> 00:25:03.567
We won’t let you be alone.

00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:17.686
Farm must really hate me.

00:25:21.006 --> 00:25:23.687
Well, you totally did shitty things to him.

00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:25.273
Mai.

00:25:27.033 --> 00:25:27.782
Sorry.

00:25:32.702 --> 00:25:33.439
Van.

00:25:38.739 --> 00:25:41.009
Gosh. Did you really have to say that, Mai?

00:25:52.673 --> 00:25:54.159
Oh. Yeah, okay.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.969
You can stay at my place for now.

00:26:00.969 --> 00:26:02.766
Actually, I can go home.

00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:04.273
That way, I won’t bother you guys.

00:26:04.493 --> 00:26:05.963
And why would you be alone?

00:26:06.123 --> 00:26:07.105
We can stick together.

00:26:08.005 --> 00:26:10.039
You’re handing out permission
like you own the place.

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:11.963
What about you, though?

00:26:12.763 --> 00:26:14.414
Never thought of going home?

00:26:17.214 --> 00:26:18.743
Why would I?

00:26:19.543 --> 00:26:21.568
This is my boyfriend’s place.

00:26:23.652 --> 00:26:24.797
Ah.

00:26:25.277 --> 00:26:26.758
What?! Boyfriend?

00:26:28.298 --> 00:26:29.595
It’s not the time.

00:26:30.795 --> 00:26:33.146
Van’s going to stay here
with us for a while anyway.

00:26:33.526 --> 00:26:36.619
We can’t keep on pretending
we hate each other, right?

00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:41.035
That’s gonna kill me.

00:26:41.415 --> 00:26:42.694
You’re annoying. Get away from me.

00:26:44.314 --> 00:26:45.816
I knew it.

00:26:45.816 --> 00:26:48.444
You two have been acting weird lately.

00:26:49.744 --> 00:26:50.614
It’s a long story.

00:26:50.954 --> 00:26:53.385
I wanted to tell you,
but I never found the right moment.

00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:55.698
You can wear our clothes tonight.

00:26:56.478 --> 00:27:02.295
Farm told Mai he’ll return your stuff
once he’s done packing it.

00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:06.839
He wouldn’t even let me go back
to pack my own things?

00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:11.128
Try to understand. The wound’s still fresh.

00:27:11.408 --> 00:27:12.466
Give him time.

00:27:15.306 --> 00:27:17.795
Go shower so you can get some sleep.

00:27:18.395 --> 00:27:20.272
It’s been a really long day.

00:27:21.689 --> 00:27:23.678
Mm. I’ll take the couch.

00:27:25.118 --> 00:27:25.865
Why?

00:27:26.045 --> 00:27:27.780
We three have slept in the same bed before.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.372
In case you two want to do this and that,

00:27:33.372 --> 00:27:35.319
I don’t want to be an audience.

00:27:36.965 --> 00:27:38.285
This and that, my ass.

00:27:40.345 --> 00:27:41.665
Yeah, whatever.

00:27:41.925 --> 00:27:43.663
I just need clothes and a blanket.

00:27:44.023 --> 00:27:45.552
I want to lie down and think by myself.

00:27:46.612 --> 00:27:47.272
Don’t worry about me.

00:27:49.092 --> 00:27:49.859
Are you sure?

00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:50.825
Mm.

00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:52.388
You’re not gonna cry?

00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:53.858
Of course not.

00:27:55.418 --> 00:27:56.298
Come on, babe.

00:27:56.418 --> 00:27:58.041
Go back to our room
and have some sweet time.

00:27:58.761 --> 00:28:00.698
Babe, my foot. Just walk.

00:28:02.998 --> 00:28:03.891
This is not the time.

00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:26.861
Are you tired?

00:28:28.981 --> 00:28:29.738
What’s wrong?

00:28:31.798 --> 00:28:36.762
It feels like we’ve had
a lot to think about lately.

00:28:37.802 --> 00:28:39.751
And now Van and Farm are being like this.

00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:47.561
If you’re tired, get some rest.

00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:49.913
Leave the rest with me.

00:28:52.033 --> 00:28:54.456
You’re the one
I should be worried about the most.

00:29:02.576 --> 00:29:04.355
You’re really going to sleep in this position?

00:29:05.655 --> 00:29:06.213
Mm.

00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:07.946
You’re going to wake up sore.

00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.424
I’m afraid you’ll sleepwalk
and do things again.

00:29:12.924 --> 00:29:15.398
Let’s just sleep like this. It’s safer.

00:29:16.198 --> 00:29:21.822
But I can still do things in this position.

00:29:24.682 --> 00:29:25.739
Damn you, asshole.

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:27.238
I’m worried about you.

00:29:27.689 --> 00:29:29.162
Is that really all that’s in your head?

00:29:29.662 --> 00:29:30.323
What?

00:29:30.823 --> 00:29:32.829
I didn’t even say what kind of things.

00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:38.244
You know way too well.

00:29:39.064 --> 00:29:40.686
You’re thinking the same thing, aren’t you?

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:44.077
I’m not!

00:29:53.686 --> 00:29:54.605
Good night.

00:29:54.825 --> 00:29:55.671
I love you.

00:30:02.099 --> 00:30:04.143
Hey. What about Farm?

00:30:04.743 --> 00:30:05.563
How is he doing?

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:19.497
There, there.

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.158
It’s okay.

00:30:21.358 --> 00:30:24.351
People might not love you, but I do.

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:32.323
Mai, I can’t breathe.

00:30:32.703 --> 00:30:34.083
Dammit. You jerk.

00:30:44.317 --> 00:30:46.946
Can you hit the gas
and make that loud, cool sound?

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:54.744
That’s it! So awesome!

00:30:56.344 --> 00:30:57.960
Put on your seatbelt. We’re about to go.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.946
My hands aren’t free.

00:31:00.186 --> 00:31:01.046
Do it for me.

00:31:17.004 --> 00:31:18.601
Don’t get too close to me,

00:31:20.021 --> 00:31:21.482
or you’ll fall in love.

00:31:22.362 --> 00:31:25.108
If I fall, I can climb back up.

00:31:25.608 --> 00:31:26.739
No worries.

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:40.442
(I don’t know how serious you are about us.)

00:31:40.662 --> 00:31:43.851
(But I want it to work out.)

00:31:59.934 --> 00:32:00.691
Hey.

00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:02.586
I forgot to bring my socks.

00:32:02.846 --> 00:32:03.663
Can I borrow these?

00:32:04.463 --> 00:32:05.278
Not this pair.

00:32:07.398 --> 00:32:08.705
Why?

00:32:09.045 --> 00:32:10.713
Then what am I supposed to wear?

00:32:10.713 --> 00:32:12.280
Any pair, but not this.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.086
What’s the problem with those socks?

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.395
Oh, hey. What are you
going to do with Van’s stuff?

00:32:22.195 --> 00:32:24.054
Want me to help throw them in the bags?

00:32:26.574 --> 00:32:27.430
Let’s head out.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.539
We need to be on time for roll call.

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:30.006
You shithead. You ignored me.

00:32:34.026 --> 00:32:36.686
What kind of moving on is this?

00:32:36.846 --> 00:32:38.697
Three steps forward, five steps back.

00:32:38.697 --> 00:32:39.909
Sounds like a fun dance.

00:32:40.609 --> 00:32:43.326
Cha, cha, cha.

00:32:44.206 --> 00:32:44.706
Mai.

00:32:44.706 --> 00:32:45.206
Yes?

00:32:45.206 --> 00:32:46.047
Will you hurry up?

00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:47.017
Of course, sir.

00:32:47.017 --> 00:32:47.754
I’m coming.

00:32:57.015 --> 00:32:58.457
Wow, this is awesome.

00:33:01.317 --> 00:33:03.333
What’s up? Ran out of ideas?

00:33:04.253 --> 00:33:06.916
Yeah. I can’t think of anything.

00:33:10.376 --> 00:33:12.008
But the deadline is approaching.

00:33:13.388 --> 00:33:14.210
It’s alright.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.316
I’ll come up with something.

00:33:30.704 --> 00:33:32.127
Why are you not eating?

00:33:37.887 --> 00:33:38.739
I’m not hungry.

00:33:39.479 --> 00:33:40.315
Not hungry?

00:33:41.675 --> 00:33:42.537
You didn’t have breakfast.

00:33:42.897 --> 00:33:43.886
You’re not having lunch.

00:33:44.126 --> 00:33:45.180
You might die.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.351
Just let me freaking die.

00:34:15.445 --> 00:34:16.155
Farm.

00:34:16.155 --> 00:34:17.964
I don’t want you two
leaving things unresolved like this.

00:34:17.964 --> 00:34:19.355
Talk it out and clear the air.

00:34:19.355 --> 00:34:20.528
That could be good. Right?

00:34:20.908 --> 00:34:21.679
What are you doing?

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.372
I asked you to sniff me, but you didn’t move.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.245
Wow, you’re in deep shit.

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:53.994
I don’t want Farm to feel uncomfortable.

00:34:56.865 --> 00:34:58.314
Why are you in my class?

00:34:58.314 --> 00:34:59.405
Did you even finish your assignment?

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:06.344
You’re not eating. You’ve lost your passion.

00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:09.342
The symptoms are obvious.

00:35:10.245 --> 00:35:10.973
What symptoms?

00:35:11.551 --> 00:35:12.708
Heartbreak.

00:35:13.232 --> 00:35:13.785
Huh?

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.269
It’s true.

00:35:15.919 --> 00:35:17.151
When I broke up with my ex,

00:35:17.927 --> 00:35:19.429
I was exactly like this.

00:35:19.429 --> 00:35:20.594
Food tasted bland.

00:35:21.262 --> 00:35:22.902
Nothing made me happy.

00:35:22.902 --> 00:35:24.475
I shriveled up like a rotten vegetable.

00:35:26.154 --> 00:35:27.024
So I’m…

00:35:28.396 --> 00:35:29.400
heartbroken?

00:35:29.851 --> 00:35:31.552
Not to be pushy or anything,

00:35:31.913 --> 00:35:35.306
but I don’t want you two
leaving things unresolved like this.

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:39.672
At least talk it out and clear the air.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.591
You don’t have to get back together,

00:35:42.729 --> 00:35:44.659
but if you can go back to being friends,
that’d still be good. Right?

00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:05.479
Can you just talk to me first?

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.216
Wait, Farm.

00:36:10.216 --> 00:36:11.355
What more do you want from me?

00:36:12.258 --> 00:36:13.359
I want to apologize.

00:36:14.226 --> 00:36:15.076
Is that all?

00:36:16.671 --> 00:36:17.347
Hey.

00:36:35.687 --> 00:36:37.052
Are you being a wild teenager these days?

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.274
I came home, and you aren’t here.

00:36:40.581 --> 00:36:41.793
Just so you know, I’m sulking.

00:36:42.226 --> 00:36:45.189
Think of a way to
make it up to me on your way home.

00:36:47.609 --> 00:36:48.786
Alright. Bye.

00:36:54.095 --> 00:36:57.643
Don’t worry. This boyfriend
will keep you company in bed.

00:36:59.087 --> 00:36:59.794
No need.

00:37:00.209 --> 00:37:01.230
Don’t jump at the chance so fast.

00:37:01.393 --> 00:37:03.509
Aw. Not falling for it?

00:37:09.612 --> 00:37:10.252
What’s wrong?

00:37:10.975 --> 00:37:11.743
Are you thinking about your mom?

00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:14.219
Mm.

00:37:15.375 --> 00:37:17.392
She’s been acting strange lately.

00:37:17.915 --> 00:37:19.736
It feels like something’s going on,
but she’s not telling me.

00:37:21.325 --> 00:37:23.973
What do you think it is?

00:37:27.602 --> 00:37:28.440
That man.

00:37:28.765 --> 00:37:29.472
Your dad?

00:37:29.689 --> 00:37:30.553
I don’t have a dad.

00:37:37.608 --> 00:37:39.136
What if…

00:37:39.587 --> 00:37:40.583
Hypothetically.

00:37:41.233 --> 00:37:42.167
Just hypothetically.

00:37:42.257 --> 00:37:42.989
What if—

00:37:42.989 --> 00:37:43.918
No way!

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:49.188
I’d rather my mom date someone new

00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:50.891
than go back to him.

00:37:52.444 --> 00:37:54.405
You have no idea what she had to endure.

00:37:54.531 --> 00:37:57.188
His family. His fans.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.262
They treated my mom like she was a germ.

00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:04.446
I was young then, but I remember it clearly.

00:38:08.942 --> 00:38:10.910
But that was something other people did,

00:38:11.668 --> 00:38:12.857
not your dad.

00:38:13.308 --> 00:38:15.728
I’m not saying I’m mad
at what other people did.

00:38:16.721 --> 00:38:21.705
You know, he didn’t just
fail to protect us. He left us.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.041
I don’t think my mom
ever healed from that pain.

00:38:26.232 --> 00:38:29.228
And I don’t think the two of them
could ever fall back in love.

00:38:36.765 --> 00:38:39.315
You’re my boyfriend. You must take my side.

00:38:40.128 --> 00:38:42.811
If we run into him,
you help me chase him off.

00:38:43.678 --> 00:38:44.414
Got it?

00:38:52.026 --> 00:38:53.071
You’re the best.

00:38:54.425 --> 00:38:55.686
Come on. Let’s go shower.

00:38:55.686 --> 00:38:56.199
Mm.

00:38:56.199 --> 00:38:57.023
I’ll give you a shower.

00:38:58.612 --> 00:38:59.583
I can shower on my own.

00:38:59.583 --> 00:39:01.667
No, I’m in a good mood. Come on.

00:39:16.518 --> 00:39:17.066
Farm.

00:39:20.804 --> 00:39:21.487
Farm.

00:39:29.565 --> 00:39:30.483
Farm.

00:41:34.577 --> 00:41:35.886
I took a shower.

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.567
I smell so good.

00:41:44.217 --> 00:41:44.834
And?

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.002
Want to come here and sniff me?

00:42:03.591 --> 00:42:04.279
What are you doing?

00:42:05.398 --> 00:42:07.259
I asked you to sniff me, but you didn’t move.

00:42:10.816 --> 00:42:12.695
Because I knew if I did, it’d end up like this.

00:42:15.151 --> 00:42:15.764
Hey.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.466
J.

00:42:19.856 --> 00:42:20.540
J!

00:42:22.956 --> 00:42:23.645
You’re smart.

00:42:25.577 --> 00:42:26.960
Are you sleeping in here tonight?

00:42:30.541 --> 00:42:31.409
Then get up.

00:42:33.233 --> 00:42:33.989
Why?

00:42:34.603 --> 00:42:35.390
Up.

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:49.574
I’m afraid you’ll dream
you’re Spider-Man again.

00:43:03.532 --> 00:43:04.264
What are you doing?

00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:09.255
Continuing.

00:43:30.447 --> 00:43:31.850
I know you’re awake.

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:33.825
What should we do after waking up?

00:43:34.493 --> 00:43:37.149
Don’t tell me you came out here to look for me.

00:43:37.149 --> 00:43:38.218
Well, well.

00:43:38.218 --> 00:43:39.345
You told me to go home,

00:43:39.345 --> 00:43:41.628
yet here you are searching for me
all over the village.

00:43:41.917 --> 00:43:44.458
Look at you, newborn kitten.

00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:46.428
What the heck is Van doing?

00:43:46.428 --> 00:43:48.231
Walk away from me all you want.

00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:49.904
I’ll still follow you and love you all the same.

00:43:50.067 --> 00:43:52.710
Believe me. I love you so damn much.
