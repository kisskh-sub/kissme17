00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.019
Boss

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.579
What kind of noodles are these?

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.180
Who does business like this?

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:30.939
Bro, what's wrong with the noodles?

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:32.780
They're awful.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:35.859
You're using noodle soup as the base.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.060
You can't just mess around.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.819
Right?

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.019
Bro, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:41.260
I'm from Shaanxi.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.819
I made hand-pulled noodles in the factory canteen for eight years.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.900
I just started out on my own.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.859
I really am just learning to make rice noodles.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.939
If it weren't for this...

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.019
This... this bowl is on the house.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.379
I'll bring you two more bowls of noodles.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:50.260
Just a moment, right away.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.859
Alright, alright.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.420
It'll be quick.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.140
I'm from Hubei.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.260
I know how rice noodles should be made.

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.419
This is the right flavor.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.620
Miss.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.900
These noodles are actually pretty good.

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:23.780
They're the real deal.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.500
I'll tell my buddies to come here.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.780
They'll all come and try it.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.620
You two enjoy your meal.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.259
Bye, see you.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.259
Here.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.060
Thanks for having my back just now.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.419
Go ahead and eat, eat up.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:41.340
Thank you.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.139
Did you just arrive, or are you leaving?

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.819
I borrowed money for the bus fare.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.060
I came to Shenzhen to find work.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.699
But when I got here, I found out...

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:50.900
the garment factory is full.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.419
I'm desperate and have nowhere to go.

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.900
I don't know what to do now.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.500
It's okay, don't worry, don't worry.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.500
You eat first, go ahead and eat.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780
Why don't you stay here with me?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.500
I'll pay you a wage.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.340
You can work for me.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.020
How about it?

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.300
Or how about this...

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.060
Let's work together.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.900
It's a small business, not to get rich.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.180
But at least it can let you...

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180
stay in Shenzhen.

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:21.740
But...

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.780
I can't make noodles, I only know rice noodles.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.180
I'll make the noodles, you make the rice noodles.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.620
Then we can have a...

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.860
great north-south fusion.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.860
Then we just need to give it a name.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.060
It has a nice name.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.180
Flavor from Afar.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.620
That night,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.900
I got drunk.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:52.939
But I also had an epiphany.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.740
As long as the spirit doesn't die,

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.340
the stage can welcome you back.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.060
Life can make a U-turn.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.460
Fan Lihua.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.340
Xue Dingshan.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.020
I've heard people say,

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.500
nine somersaults...

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.939
can't outrun a step on the gas in Shenzhen.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.899
I got my license and a car.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.779
Planning to go and drive a taxi.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.180
Isn't it a coincidence...

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.180
that *The Final Curtain* is the closing show again.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.500
Just like fifteen years ago,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.980
the first show you and I performed.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.300
Master said,

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.939
if the red tassel isn't cut, the stage bond remains.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.420
It's over now.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.100
This opera...

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.180
I'll sing it for a lifetime.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.939
You do as you please.

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:06.220
Go on, hurry.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.620
Go.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.699
I just want to...

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.100
fulfill myself one more time.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.339
One second before the lightbulb shattered,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.339
I was thinking...

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.779
if we could sign a permanent contract.

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:56.939
One second before the lightbulb shattered,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.899
I was thinking...

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.980
Actually,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.019
we've known each other for a long time.

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.540
Okay, okay, I know.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.180
I know, boss.

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:08.220
Good.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.420
Good, good.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.500
Please page 4869.

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:16.980
Message: Pile foundation.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.540
Re-inspect pile foundation per BS standard.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:21.980
Hong Kong party arriving in Shenzhen tomorrow.

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.139
Leaving immediately.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.860
If matter, please call back.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.339
2756.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.660
Hey, big shot.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.980
Headquarters is pushing for the order.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.540
Give me some face, okay?

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.579
Please call back 2756.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.660
Message:

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.980
Wrong number.

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:55.660
What BS?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.699
Bullshit?

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.779
Please reply to 4869.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.100
Sorry.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.220
Don't know why sent to wrong person.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.860
Please forgive my bullshit.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:10.500
Please call back 2756.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.180
Message:

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.819
I lost my temper for no reason.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.860
I'm also bullshit.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.740
I'm from a Hong Kong construction company.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.019
A stationed engineer.

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:27.180
After the handover,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.220
came to Shenzhen for commercial real estate.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.100
I'm also from Hong Kong, China.

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:33.139
Came after the handover to do trade.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.540
Want to sell jeans made in Shenzhen...

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.740
to the whole world.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:39.819
Do you take the night shift...

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:40.899
cross-border bus?

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.819
Driver Master Chen...

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.379
loves to play *Di Nü Hua* the most.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.860
I've taken the earliest bus,

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:48.339
the seven o'clock one.

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:50.060
It always plays *Wanderer's Autumn Lament*.

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:54.899
So you also went to St. Paul's Co-educational College.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.060
Remember the cafeteria?

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.540
The most popular wonton noodles.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.620
I think the best part...

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.459
was the pork cracklings.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.740
The auntie always saved an extra plate for me.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.339
Hello, your noodles.

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:08.540
Thank you.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.740
Wait.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.579
Do you have any pork cracklings?

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:12.220
Just a moment.

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:18.259
Isn't it strange?

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.980
We lived on neighboring streets.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.339
And went to the same school.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.220
How could we have kept missing each other?

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:27.139
Not strange at all.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.139
Maybe it was fate.

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:30.899
That we'd meet in Shenzhen.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:34.299
Please leave a message.

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:37.220
Heavy rain in Shenzhen. Remember to close your windows.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.820
Please reply.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.299
Let's meet when the rain stops.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:11.539
I know, boss.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:13.220
But the fax machine is jammed.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.539
I'm already sending it.

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:16.220
I don't care if it's jammed or not.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.340
Today's the last day.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.419
Get it sent out right now.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.259
Darn it, I need to see him today.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.940
Hurry up, please!

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.340
Is there any food left?

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.259
Shenzhen.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.059
Is the heroic world in my heart.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.580
At this moment,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.379
I think of many heroes.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:23.860
I decide

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.460
To be like them.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.740
And charge forward.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.379
I'm a discharged soldier.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.779
That fat guy,

00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:47.179
He's a steel mill worker.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.980
Used to roll steel bars.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:49.899
Now he escorts cash.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.620
Carrying the real deal.

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:52.620
Cash.

00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:53.659
Yes.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.179
I, I just last month

00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:57.940
Came from the bank security department.

00:10:59.139 --> 00:10:59.779
This

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:03.379
Is our business license.

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:07.779
Shenzhen Safe-Arrival Escort.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.379
Right.

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:10.860
We're the first in the country.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.419
Well, the few of us

00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:14.299
Have no experience.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.220
Don't even know if we should carry guns.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.100
The city bureau told us to go

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.539
To the military district for a permit to find out.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.860
Planning an escort route.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.220
I've bought

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.220
Over thirty map books.

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:26.539
What's in your woven plastic bag?

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.500
What are you carrying?

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:28.340
Gold bars?

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.620
Open it, open it.

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:31.539
Our company just opened.

00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:32.460
I wanted to save money,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.980
But also make it lively.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.059
So we

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:36.740
Made our own lion dance troupe.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.659
It was a mix-up.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.460
Actually,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.980
I knew from the start

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:50.539
You didn't seem like bad guys.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.860
What kind of brazen bandit

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.220
Chases a cop to ask about guns?

00:11:55.419 --> 00:11:56.419
Not bad guys.

00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:57.980
Look at your posture.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.860
Straighter than the Shenzhen River.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.659
Proves you're

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.940
Good men.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.500
That's why I only used thirty percent of my strength.

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:07.700
Let's be friends.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.100
Here, here, here.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.659
Have a smoke.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.820
You must be exhausted

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.539
After a night on the train.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.259
Thanks.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:14.740
Shaanxi-style minced pork.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.980
Cantonese char siu.

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:17.740
Northern chili, southern rice noodles.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.980
And this ladle of sizzling hot oil.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.100
And this ladle of sizzling hot oil.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.419
Flavor from Afar.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.259
Order up.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.980
It really is fragrant.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.139
So good, so good.

00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:28.860
Is your camera broken?

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.779
Does it still work?

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:30.860
I'm not sure either.

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:31.940
Let's give it a try.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:33.700
Well then,

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.340
I'll take a photo for everyone.

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:37.500
I...

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.059
Sure, sure, great.

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:39.940
Take a photo.

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:10.820
Miaomiao.

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:14.259
Actually, I have something more to say.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.740
I like you.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.779
Let's be together.

00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:51.220
Boss Hong manages six shops now.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.899
But he still can't tie a tie.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.100
Who wears this normally?

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.740
This is for normal days?

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.740
Isn't this our silver anniversary?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.860
Aren't you here?

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.860
You can sort everything out for me.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.620
Okay, ready to shoot.

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:06.419
How long has it been since our last photo together?

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.580
You two,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.220
Could you be a bit more natural?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.779
And this is your silver anniversary?

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:14.460
You're as stiff as strangers.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.419
If you can't talk nicely, don't talk.

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:17.700
Come on, Brother Fu.

00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:19.139
Look at the lens, hold it.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.220
Three.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.220
Two.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.220
One.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.019
Good, one more.

00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:25.379
Move your heads closer.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.139
Closer.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.340
A bit too close.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.820
A little apart, good.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.220
Brother Fu, smile.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.620
Good.
