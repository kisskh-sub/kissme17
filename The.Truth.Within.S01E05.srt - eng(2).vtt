WEBVTT

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.620
Shuting,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.090
where are you?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.620
Why weren't you answering?

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.540
Well, any leads?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.290
Not yet.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.010
I need to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.690
verify something.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.290
But I believe

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.060
the killer could not

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.610
change his behavior pattern so easily.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.410
If our reasoning is correct,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.610
then Xie Yaoqi

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.340
still has a chance.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.340
Forensics has confirmed

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.220
the tread and soil

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.500
on the sneakers

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.540
from Liao Yunsheng's home

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.260
match the findings

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.260
from the bat cave.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.410
And we already know

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.130
his involvement in the
bovine TB experiments.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.850
All the evidence points to

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.810
his presence at the crime scene.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.340
Now Liao Yunsheng

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.370
is the prime suspect.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.410
The victim

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.660
is the owner of the phone

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.540
found yesterday at Liao's place.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.020
I told you

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.930
I saw her yesterday.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.810
Xie Yaoqi's friend,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.490
Li Shuting.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.980
The hair found at the pork shop

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.900
has been confirmed

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.370
to be Xie Yaoqi's.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.490
So, based on this,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.490
we can infer

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.580
that after killing

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.930
Ye Yingying,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.930
Liao Yunsheng kidnapped

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.540
Xie Yaoqi and Li Shuting.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.980
I checked Li Shuting's phone.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.540
Not much useful info.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.220
The killer might have deleted it.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.540
We only know she's 25.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.660
Both parents are dead.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.100
No other family.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.140
Her place

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.980
is under her name,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.220
but it's outdated.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.730
The landlord says she moved out

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.540
years ago.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.410
What about Xie Yaoqi's place?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.730
Like her parents said,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.930
covered in dust.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.140
No one's been here in ages.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.540
Well, Mr. Qi,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.100
any leads

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.370
on the syringe

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.410
from Liao's home?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.170
The residue in it

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.410
has been identified.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.250
It's funnel-web spider toxin.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.540
Same as in Ye Yingying's body.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.810
Based on

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.020
your calendar theory,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.780
the killer is mimicking a spider.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.290
He kidnapped Xie Yaoqi

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.490
three days after killing

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.340
Ye Yingying.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.290
Then why did he

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.810
take Li Shuting earlier this time?

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.900
Su,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.020
get a BOLO

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.980
issued on Liao

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.660
to all units.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.100
Xi, keep checking the cameras.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.540
Wan,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.810
check around

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.290
his place.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.170
Ms. Zhu, we're on the funnel-web spider.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.580
Funnel-web spider.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.050
Funnel-web spider.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.250
Funnel-web spider?

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.580
Dr. Chen.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.100
You brat,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.340
sending me such expensive wine?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.100
This wine

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.900
reminds me

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.780
of our school days.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.410
You and Li Ming

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.610
often came find me

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.900
for a drink after school.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.410
Well,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.250
how have you been feeling?

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.610
Not bad.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.730
Don't worry.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.140
Anytime you need help, come find me.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.220
My rates are steep.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.170
I actually have something

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.370
to ask you about.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.290
Go ahead.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.220
Here's the thing.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.050
Do you know there's a type of person

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.580
who imagines themselves

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.580
to be a certain animal?

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.020
For example,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.220
a spider.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.810
A moment.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.100
Here.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.290
See.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.700
Clinical lycanthropy.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.930
A type of

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.020
mental illness.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.220
During an episode, the patient

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.050
believes they are a wolf.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.540
Their lifestyle

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.660
mimics that of a wolf.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.100
It's not

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.930
just wolves

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.730
they imagine being.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.810
They can imagine being other animals.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.140
Like insects.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.900
You said someone might think

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.220
they're a spider.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.020
It's highly possible.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.220
Chen,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.780
do you know

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.020
what causes this?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.540
The causes of mental illness

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.730
are complex.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.490
With physical illnesses,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.490
you can pinpoint

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.730
an exact origin.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.410
But mental illness

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.610
is rooted

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.580
in abnormal brain function.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.140
The triggers

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.370
can be

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.050
psychological trauma,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.370
family issues,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.050
medication overuse,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.700
or even drugs.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.100
Do they

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.770
really lose the line between delusion

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.580
and reality?

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.300
During an episode,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.940
these patients

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.770
fabricate lies that
deceive their own minds.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.010
For them,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.250
it's genuine.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.180
Mr. Qi,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.370
the materials

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.530
from Liao Yunsheng's greenhouse

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.420
are here.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.610
After mating,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.340
female spiders

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.530
may kill the males.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.100
For funnel-web spiders, the average time

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.250
from mating to egg-laying is 13 days.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.340
Thirteen days?

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.660
You mean

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.850
he wants to lay eggs himself?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.660
Alright, send me the photos.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.900
Qi Sizhe says,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.610
based on

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.700
the materials we found,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.130
Liao Yunsheng truly thinks

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.930
he is a spider.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.420
The 13 days on the calendar

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.970
is the time

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.900
from mating to
egg-laying for funnel-webs.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.060
So

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.980
he wrapped the victim into an egg?

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.300
Yeah,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.420
pretty much.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.420
Funnel-webs are highly venomous.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.340
No way I'd sell them.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.650
Who knows what could happen?

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.300
Are you the only spider seller

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.060
around here?

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.130
Yes.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.010
I'm the only one for miles.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.010
Have you seen him?

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.490
He's Liao Yunsheng.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.220
No.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.940
Any membership info?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.580
I run a traditional business.
No computer.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.730
I only keep records for deliveries.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.060
Sir.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.180
What will a funnel-web spider do

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.940
when its habitat

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.850
is destroyed?

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.300
Find a new place

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.610
to build a web.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.250
Sedentary.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.700
Nest in fixed locations.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.220
The nest provides for feeding, capture,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.250
shelter, and breeding.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.580
They don't migrate frequently.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.890
Territoriality.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.610
Highly territorial

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.700
around their nest.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.530
After building a nest,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.420
they'll defend

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.940
their domain and resources.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.250
Nocturnal. Mostly active at night.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.180
During the day, they hide in the nest

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:37.980
to avoid sunlight

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.130
and predators.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.820
Mostly active at night.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.580
Don't migrate frequently.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.220
If Liao Yunsheng is really mimicking

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.490
a spider,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.180
then that cave

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.420
was his nest.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.180
He killed Ye Yingying

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.180
and wanted to kill Xie Yaoqi,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.610
but Xie escaped.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.730
Mr. Qi barged into the cave,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.730
forcing him to relocate

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.940
and make a new web.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.530
Perhaps at a specific time,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.300
Li Shuting intruded

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.610
and became his next target.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.010
Right.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.940
Liao Yunsheng usually helps out

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.700
at his uncle's illegal clinic.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.340
Ye Yingying and Xie Yaoqi

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.300
had both been there.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.940
Li Shuting also went there later.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.730
Liao must have been scouting

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.060
for victims there.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.700
But I still don't get it.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.700
Mr. Qi says

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.850
the victim is not prey,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.010
but an egg.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.130
Why?

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.180
Giving birth.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.180
Giving birth?

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.340
Qi Sizhe mentioned this

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.420
on the phone.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.490
After mating,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.100
female spiders

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.770
may kill the males.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.580
But there were no signs

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.610
of sexual assault on Ye Yingying.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.370
Yeah,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.850
that's what's puzzling me.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:57.300
Hello?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.220
Got it.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.010
Mr. Han,

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.180
they received

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.370
a distress call.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.530
Might be Li Shuting.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.100
Help me!

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.850
He said tonight,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.980
after killing Yaoqi, he'll kill me.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.300
It's very dark here.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.730
I can hear machinery.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.490
It cut off here?

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.420
Can we trace it?

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.060
No caller ID.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.300
And the call was too short.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.490
No way to track it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.700
She heard machinery.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.530
Maybe near a factory?

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:47.770
Xi,

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.980
can we run a check?

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.890
I will

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.530
give it a try.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.490
Come on!

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.850
Do you know

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.770
how many factories

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.130
there are in this city?

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.730
How would you check?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.730
Then how?

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.940
We must check!

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.250
There is a way

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.420
to narrow it down.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.610
Funnel-webs don't migrate.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.490
But if their habitat

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.610
is destroyed,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.250
they'll seek a new place.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.220
I think

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.580
we should search around

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.300
the Beishan cave

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.820
and his home.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.940
He can't have gone far.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.610
Now he just needs

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.420
a new hiding place

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.580
where is dark, damp,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.580
low-traffic,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.580
and suitable

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.300
for funnel-webs.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.980
We're running out of time.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.700
Since the body

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.010
was found in the cave,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.530
let's search the area

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.130
around it.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.100
Request support from all precincts.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.100
Have them check near
Liao Yunsheng's home

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.340
for any suspicious places.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.250
We'll split up.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.940
Yes.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.300
What about

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.530
the Xiangfan Factory west of

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.770
Beishan South Road?

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.850
It's abandoned.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.650
Fits a funnel-web's needs.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.420
What else

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.850
around there that fit?

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.580
All residential.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.100
Not suitable.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.340
Mr. Han,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.530
I spotted

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.420
someone suspicious

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.100
on the camera.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.180
He was carrying

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.250
an empty terrarium

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.490
and wearing a black hoodie.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.820
Could it be Liao?

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.980
Location?

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.700
Beishan South Road.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.770
Not far from that factory.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.300
We split up.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.010
Okay.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.060
Mr. Qi,

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.340
I'll check there.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.850
Be careful.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.330
Qi Sizhe!

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.010
You okay?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.090
Yeah, go after him.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.380
Mr. Qi, are you fine?

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.570
Didn't see his face.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.530
Are you okay?

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.900
Li Shuting,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.530
can you tell us

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.900
what happened?

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.570
Sorry.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.660
I didn't

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.380
tell you before.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.770
Actually, Yaoqi

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.660
was dating Liao Yunsheng.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.380
I thought

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.250
she was hiding

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.290
to avoid her parents.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.700
I thought

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.530
she was with Liao Yunsheng.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.570
I wanted to talk to her,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.420
so I went to Liao Yunsheng's place.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.810
I...

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.140
But...

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:31.860
Yaoqi?

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.530
Yaoqi?

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.140
Yaoqi?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.900
Yaoqi?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.700
Did you see him clearly? Was it Liao?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.570
No.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.860
And you?

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.180
Did you see

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.330
his face?

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.730
I only know

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.090
he wore

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.980
a black hoodie.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.490
He showed me some paintings.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.810
What painting?

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.490
Of Yaoqi.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.940
He drew her.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.250
Her looks when she died.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.090
It's horrifying.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.090
What did he do

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.770
to you?

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.940
He believes

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.010
he's a spider.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.250
He kept wrapping me

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.570
in plastic wrap.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.490
I couldn't breathe.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.380
You've met Liao Yunsheng.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.770
Was it him?

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.980
Do they

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.220
really lose the line between delusion

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.700
and reality?

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.220
I don't know.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.860
I was too scared.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.010
During an episode,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.530
these patients

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.140
fabricate lies that
deceive their own minds.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.290
For them,

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.620
it's genuine.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.940
I only found

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.980
Li Ming's DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.940
in the car.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.010
But when you were unconscious,

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.050
you saw someone.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.420
Your intuition

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.570
and your memory

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.860
are unreliable.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.330
Qi Sizhe,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:26.900
you just can't

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.730
convince yourself

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.420
that the Raw Diamond case is over.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.530
You're refusing to face reality.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.050
You okay?

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.420
I'm fine.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.530
If what Li Shuting says is true,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.090
is Xie Yaoqi

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.330
in serious danger?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.010
Something doesn't add up.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.140
What?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.940
Based on the evidence,

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.530
we infer

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.730
that the killer

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:12.980
has a mental illness.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:14.620
During episodes,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.700
he imagines himself as a spider,

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.530
adopting its habits

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.810
and behavioral patterns.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:21.700
This much is clear.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.420
Then

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.700
after killing Xie,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.810
he should have

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.770
waited until August 30th

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.330
to go after the next person.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.420
He shouldn't have taken Li Shuting

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.730
at this time.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.620
But why?

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.700
If he really thinks

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.940
he's a spider,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.860
he wouldn't easily break

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.050
his established pattern.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.700
Something must have happened

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.660
to force him to change his plan.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.290
Perhaps Li Shuting

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.660
found something,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.730
so he had to

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.290
kill her in advance?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.940
That's possible.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.700
However,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.620
her statement doesn't add up.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.860
He believes

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.010
he's a spider.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.180
He kept wrapping me

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.420
in plastic wrap.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.420
I couldn't breathe.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.250
Clearly,

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.570
he was in an episode

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.700
and believed

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.140
he was a spider,

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.730
so he chose

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.330
an abandoned factory

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.620
that suits a spider's needs.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.940
But the events

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.860
at that factory

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.620
don't feel right.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:39.980
Let's go.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.330
To the scene.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.770
Find out

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.620
what's off.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.730
This is the abandoned factory

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.770
where Li was found.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.180
This is where Xi spotted Liao Yunsheng

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.530
on the cameras.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.660
Since Mr. Qi

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.330
was attacked at the factory,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.570
we've set up checkpoints

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.860
at major intersections nearby.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.570
All units are assisting

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.700
in Liao's arrest.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.900
The cave

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.940
where Ye's body was found,

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.530
Liao's uncle's illegal clinic,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.530
and his university

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.530
are under surveillance.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.530
We'll be the first

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.330
to know.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.050
Good.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.050
Wan, you and Su take a team each.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.810
Search all suspicious places

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.660
one more time.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.290
This time, we can't let him get away.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.380
Yes.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.290
The first two scenes

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.730
both had funnel-web nets

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.090
left by the killer.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.980
Why are there none here?

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.050
He killed Ye Yingying

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.090
in the cave.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.570
Then he brought

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.380
Xie Yaoqi there,

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.730
because that was

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:14.860
his nest.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.250
Now he brought

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.140
Li Shuting here.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.010
If he saw this

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.620
as his new nest,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.290
Xie Yaoqi should be here.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.050
But she's not.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.660
There are no webs here.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.860
And the 13-day cycle is broken.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.570
Why would

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:37.940
the killer

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.250
change his own pattern?

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.140
So he changed

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.290
and decided to kill Xie Yaoqi early?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.330
Hello.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:28.900
Hello.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.620
ID. Driver's license.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.570
Pop the trunk.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:31.140
Okay.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:35.940
Here.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.330
Well, thanks.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.290
Thank you.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:53.730
You're welcome.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.730
Is something happening?

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.490
Just routine check.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.420
Maggie.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.180
Sorry.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.700
I got stopped at a police checkpoint.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.050
Is the client here?

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.530
Not yet.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.770
I hit a checkpoint too.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.530
Really?

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.570
People near the Beishan cave say

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.620
the police

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.700
found a woman's body.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.570
They've been asking around

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.220
if anyone keeps spiders.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.250
Strange, right?

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.250
Why spiders?

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.770
Don't tell me that girl

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.860
was killed by a spider?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.180
That's fearsome.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.140
Good thing I didn't book you

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.620
with that client.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.660
If you'd gotten bitten too,

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.900
I'd be out of a job.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:48.420
What client?

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:50.420
He came a few days ago

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.810
and looked odd.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:53.810
Wore a hat

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.530
and was bundled up tight.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.530
He was fiddling with

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.380
a medicine bottle

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.570
or something.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.490
I asked if he was okay.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.180
He said he wanted to see a doctor

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.570
and felt like a spider.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.330
Do you know there's a type of person

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.620
who imagines

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.570
themselves to be a certain animal?

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.980
For example,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.250
a spider.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.860
Did you register him?

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.860
I was about to,

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.570
but when I came back with the form,

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.660
he was gone.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.180
Well, check the footage.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.090
See if it caught him.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.900
Qi,

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.250
I'd like

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.180
to tell you something.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.050
Any other angles?

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.860
He didn't enter.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.180
There's only one camera.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.530
Is that him?

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.090
He wore a hat. I didn't see clearly.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.330
Thanks, Chen.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.940
Hello? Ms. Zhu.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.250
Okay.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.620
I'll deploy teams now.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.010
Everyone,

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.730
we have a new lead.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.420
After Ye Yingying was taken,

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.700
the killer went to

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:30.900
this psychology clinic.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.420
Use this clinic

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.180
as the center.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.530
Check every nearby crossroads

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.770
and look for

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.700
the killer's trace.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.980
Maybe we could find Xie Yaoqi.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:39.980
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.620
Ms. Zhu,

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.050
after leaving

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.050
the clinic,

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.290
he traveled via Beiyi Road

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:53.660
and headed south.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:01.940
Dongning Road's camera

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.770
didn't catch him.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.180
Here. Xiwan Road, southbound.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.220
Ms. Zhu, we've got him.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.570
He exited the highway and went nearby,

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.420
then vanished.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.290
Must be in a nearby neighborhood.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.380
Mr. Han, we've found him.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.740
Ms. Zhu?

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.300
Hello.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.300
All old neighborhoods here.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.940
South gate.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.610
North gate.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.570
Only seniors

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.530
live here.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.740
Only these two

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.650
have young people.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.570
I see.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.260
We'll split up.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.050
Wan,

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.090
you, the local officer, and Su

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:34.380
search there.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.650
I, Mr. Han,

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.130
and Mr. Qi will search here.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:37.820
Okay.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.050
Let's go.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:07.980
Mr. Han,

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.380
the precinct

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.380
contacted the committee.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.530
Several renters there

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.690
match the suspect's profile.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.740
When processing evidence

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.130
from the greenhouse,

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.820
we found a water bill.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.130
It's unit 604.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.010
604.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.570
Here.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.820
It's Liao Yunsheng.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.130
We've been misled.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.980
Liao Yunsheng was the first victim.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.170
You suspect Xie Yaoqi?

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.090
We all thought Xie Yaoqi was a victim.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.340
No one can prove she was kidnapped.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.010
Why did the killer change his pattern

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.300
when it came to Li Shuting?

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.050
Li Shuting?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.340
Li Shuting?

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:20.650
Estradiol Valerate Tablets.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.490
Women take it for ovarian health

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.090
and fertility.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.130
What if a man uses it?

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.010
Who's this person?

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:28.940
Wang Qilong.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.650
Has something happened to Shuting?

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.300
Answer our questions first.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.940
I don't know anything.
