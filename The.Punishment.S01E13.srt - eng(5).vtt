00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.150
Mai.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.150
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.030
I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.080
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.160
[Taxi]

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.030
Mai.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.240
Dealing with him

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.410
is just a piece of cake.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.560
It's not difficult.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.690
I found it out.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.120
When he was drunk,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.100
I checked his dashcam.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.840
There's an abandoned building
in the western suburbs.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.640
He goes there three times a week.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.120
Every time he goes,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.030
he carries a lot of water and food.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.670
I guess whoever's hiding there
is either Luo Bo

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.550
or Song Hao.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.450
Alright. I'll drive you home.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.000
Why aren't you two eating anything?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.440
Still opening your mouth?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.900
Still opening your mouth?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.120
Open. Open.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.200
You.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.270
You.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.440
Look at these two.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.320
Mr. Ma.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.550
Mr. Wang is here.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.270
Mr. Wang.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.850
Please have a seat.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.030
Playing with your crocodiles?

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.550
I don't know
what's wrong with them these days.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.080
They just don't want to eat.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.470
What brings you here?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.560
I won't care about Song Hao anymore.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.480
Do whatever you want.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.390
I

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.000
came from the mountains.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.600
My ancestors

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.120
made a living by hunting.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.790
But they had

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.240
an unwritten rule.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.720
Never hunt injured prey.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.270
In spring,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.790
never hunt pregnant prey.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.670
Take wolves for example.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.240
You don't touch their cubs.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.320
If you touch their cubs,

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.120
they'll fight you to the death.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.120
Mr. Wang.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.320
I understand what you mean.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.720
Actually,
you should know that all these years,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.270
I've never had any designs

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.870
on any member of your family,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.000
except only on Song Hao now.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.750
Because he knows too much.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.670
Rest assured.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.080
I made

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.320
Luo Bo stay in Hanzhou

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.200
precisely for your son-in-law.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.550
Listen.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.320
Tomorrow.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.670
Once tomorrow passes,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.630
we can all sleep soundly.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.670
You asked Luo to do this kind of thing.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.910
Aren't you worried something might happen?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.170
I have no other choice.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.560
I can only entrust it to him.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.390
Even if something happens,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.390
I believe he won't betray me.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.270
Back then, his father

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.910
sacrificed himself for you.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.550
Now, for you, his son...

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.870
Ma,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.080

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.030
Mr. Wang,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.030
for people like us,

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.870
if we leave others a way out,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.210
it's like
walking ourselves into a dead end.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.000
Goodbye.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.510
Mr. Ma.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.390
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.910
Song Hao

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.580
will appear
at the East Long-Distance Bus Station.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.150
Kid,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.320
I can only

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.030
entrust this to you.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.030
Okay,

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.000
Mr. Ma.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.320
I think now I should

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.980
help make things clear to you.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.720
Song Hao's problem is very serious.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.030
I also know

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.060
you want to take the child
and leave with him.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.260
If you are completely unaware

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:14.920
of what Song Hao did,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.400
you and the child are innocent.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.270
But if

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.160
you take the child and run away with him,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.300
then I'm sorry,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.120
the nature would change.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.440
You'd commit a crime.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.370
You'd be fugitives in the future.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.580
And it's not even certain
if you can manage to leave.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.250
I don't know what you think,

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.180
but the child is too young.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.920

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.870
I just hope

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.130
you can cooperate with us.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.980

We just changed clothes and had a meeting.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.330
that old injury on your hand—

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.940
does it still hurt?

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.550
Sometimes.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.350
It's been hurting again these days.

The weather's about to change.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.910
Remember to put on more clothes.

If it weren't for you back then,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.410
that knife would have hit my neck.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.460
You once took a stab for Tao.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.170
Back when I first joined the station,

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.270
you told me

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.070
I should live up to this uniform I wear.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.110
That's what you said.

So I don't understand
what's wrong with you.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.920
What I said back then

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.480
was what I thought.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:49.810
Then what's wrong now?

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.110
You once took a stab for him,

but what you're doing now

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.510
is stabbing us in the back, Ji.
