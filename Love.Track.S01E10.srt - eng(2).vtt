(Original story by Lee Do Woo
"A Soundtrack Like No Other")

00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:33.324
(Kang Han Na, Kim Min Gue)

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:40.297
("A Very Old First Love")

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:29.813
I was only going to read a few pages.

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:38.555
("A Promise to You")

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.324
("Did you write these lyrics?"
"Yeah.")

00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:41.959
("That's a nice title."
"It's nothing special.")

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.360
("No, it's really good.")

00:01:54.204 --> 00:01:57.508
("A Promise to You")

00:01:57.508 --> 00:02:00.444
(No search results for "A Promise to You")

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.954
("A Promise to You")

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:12.222
(No search results for "A Promise to You")

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.028
So I guess it really is a song
that doesn't exist.

(A Soundtrack Like No Other)

00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:25.930
What I used to know

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.969
Everything's all changed

00:03:33.137 --> 00:03:36.407
Since I met you

00:03:42.646 --> 00:03:46.417
I don't know why I'm this way

00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:50.921
Nothing's the same

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.826
Because of you

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:02.132
Someone, feels like it's controlling me

00:04:02.132 --> 00:04:05.836
This song was made by a woman
who had endured a long, unrequited love...

00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:09.473
to finally confess her feelings...

00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:12.409
in the novel I wrote.

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:15.946
So...

00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:19.750
this was originally a song
that doesn't exist in this world.

00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:25.956
I truly enjoyed reading your novel,

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:27.524
"A Very Old First Love."

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:32.730
The story of two people who silently
loved each other for 20 years...

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.798
shook me deeply.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.603
The tenderness of them
circling one another,

00:04:40.404 --> 00:04:43.207
and the feelings they kept unspoken
for each other, felt especially poignant,

00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:46.143
And that's why it felt
like an even deeper kind of love.

00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:50.247
I really wanted to hear
the music mentioned in the novel,

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.650
but it turns out
the song doesn't actually exist.

00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:54.885
If it's not an imposition,

00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:57.087
I wanted to try creating it myself.

00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.823
Please think of it
as a reader's response...

00:04:59.823 --> 00:05:02.192
from someone who studies music.

00:05:03.994 --> 00:05:06.697
Sincerely, Park Yoo Shin.

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:21.645
("A Very Old First Love")

00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:26.483
I thought no one would ever notice.

00:05:34.592 --> 00:05:36.427
- I'll be back.
- Good luck.

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:40.764
No way. Isn't that basically a proposal?

00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:45.102
How did you jump to the conclusion?

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.671
I mean, come on, anyone would hear that...

00:05:48.138 --> 00:05:50.574
as "I'm interested in you."

00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:53.310
The book didn't even sell many copies.

00:05:54.912 --> 00:05:57.081
How did he find your email address?

00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:59.083
It was written on the book flap.

00:06:00.517 --> 00:06:01.485
The flap?

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:02.753
I knew it.

00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:04.121
Your profile photo's there too.

00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:06.123
All moody and atmospheric.

00:06:07.258 --> 00:06:08.726
You were super pretty back then.

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:11.629
I've never even taken a profile photo.

00:06:12.463 --> 00:06:13.330
Really?

00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:16.333
So he really contacted you
just because he liked the novel?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.803
So he understands how two people
could like each other for 20 years...

00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:22.373
without ever confessing?

00:06:23.207 --> 00:06:24.308
That kind of foolish thing?

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.478
I guess so.

00:06:28.712 --> 00:06:29.747
My goodness.

00:06:30.114 --> 00:06:31.815
Wait.

00:06:31.815 --> 00:06:34.018
Then never saying
"I love you" the whole time,

00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:35.853
and then the moment
he gets a terminal diagnosis,

00:06:36.887 --> 00:06:40.357
he goes, "Actually,
I've loved you for a long time."

00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:41.659
That makes sense to him?

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:46.597
"What? Actually, you were
also my true love all along."

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:47.598
That kind of thing?

00:06:48.065 --> 00:06:50.167
Was it really that bad?

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:51.402
Of course.

00:06:51.402 --> 00:06:53.337
What was he doing
when he was strong and healthy?

00:06:54.438 --> 00:06:56.140
If it were me, I'd never accept that.

00:06:57.174 --> 00:07:00.611
If he hid his feelings to the end,
then I'd call that love.

00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:04.548
If he left her a 1.4-million-dollar
apartment as an inheritance,

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:06.016
then I'd totally call that love.

00:07:08.552 --> 00:07:09.887
Good thing I quit.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:12.656
I can't even convince my friend
and you're this worked up.

00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:14.291
Well,

00:07:15.025 --> 00:07:16.493
even so,

00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:19.730
someone who truly understood...

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.599
your intention and emotional arc appeared.

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:24.101
That's the whole point of this.

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:25.569
Isn't it?

00:07:26.937 --> 00:07:28.539
You sure can talk.

00:07:29.573 --> 00:07:30.507
Hey.

00:07:31.342 --> 00:07:33.277
Hey, Jung Ji Eum, where are you going?
Wait for me.

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:43.287
(I received your email.)

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:51.228
(The best reader's response...)

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:57.701
- Pass.
- Nice.

00:07:58.402 --> 00:07:59.303
Shoot.

00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:01.839
Nice.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.607
Hey, one point left.

00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:04.575
Hurry.

00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:06.944
- Hey, stop fighting.
- Hurry.

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.245
(You have received an email.)

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.614
- Play.
- I'll go in.

00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:11.548
Hey, what are you doing?

00:08:12.483 --> 00:08:13.817
Hey, what are you doing? Come on.

00:08:13.817 --> 00:08:14.985
What? Where are you going, Yoo Shin?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.154
Just keep playing.

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:21.025
Nice.

00:08:22.826 --> 00:08:24.461
I received your email.

00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:26.597
It was the best reader's response.

00:08:27.464 --> 00:08:31.569
The protagonist's choice in the novel
didn't receive much support.

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:34.872
But after listening to the song you sent,

00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:37.975
I came to think
that maybe that doesn't really matter.

00:08:38.943 --> 00:08:41.679
Thanks to you, I felt a little happier.

00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:45.249
I hope today is a happy day
for you too, Yoo Shin.

00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:46.550
Sincerely, Jung Ji Eum.

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:48.652
What are you doing?

00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:50.254
Go on.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.759
Guys, something urgent came up,
so I'm leaving. Sorry.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.695
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, Park Yoo Shin.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.864
P.S.

00:09:00.864 --> 00:09:03.000
For a song Ha Rin made,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.236
I thought it felt a little sad.

00:09:06.537 --> 00:09:09.974
But Ha Rin, who chose love,
must have been happy.

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:28.492
You once said...

00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:32.229
that after you came to like that person,

00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:35.599
there wasn't a single moment
you were unhappy.

00:09:44.842 --> 00:09:47.678
Thinking only from my own point of view,
I forgot that.

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:52.349
When will I be able
to read your next work?

00:09:53.183 --> 00:09:56.587
I'm really looking forward
to how wonderful your next story will be.

00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:13.237
Unfortunately,
I'm not writing novels at the moment.

00:10:13.938 --> 00:10:17.808
There wasn't any particular reason
I stopped writing.

00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:21.378
I just suddenly realized...

00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:23.747
that I needed more experiences...

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:26.750
and more heart.

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:30.955
That realization
didn't make me depressed or sad.

00:10:31.822 --> 00:10:35.059
Not everyone with talent
ends up using it that way,

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:38.629
and I think it's better
than spending your whole life...

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:41.165
not knowing whether you had
that talent or not.

00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:44.235
When I die,

00:10:44.235 --> 00:10:46.870
I want to fully know...

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.906
what kind of things I was good at.

00:10:49.807 --> 00:10:51.075
"Actually,"

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:54.445
"this line is from a movie I like?"

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:02.820
("Where the Light Fell")

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.932
Is it really fate?

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:22.873
No.

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:25.676
This is far too famous for that.

00:11:33.617 --> 00:11:36.220
(Unfortunately,
I'm not writing novels at the moment.)

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:39.723
- Hey, Yoo Shin, you're early.
- Hi, Yoo Shin.

00:11:39.723 --> 00:11:41.525
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:42.526
How unexpected.

00:11:44.795 --> 00:11:46.096
I can't believe you're not late today.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.564
I stayed up all night.

00:11:48.032 --> 00:11:49.033
Gaming?

00:11:49.533 --> 00:11:50.534
No.

00:11:52.836 --> 00:11:55.139
Don't tell me you were working.

00:11:56.273 --> 00:11:57.374
No way.

00:11:58.309 --> 00:12:00.010
I had a sudden meetup with my guildmates.

00:12:00.411 --> 00:12:02.212
I drank way too much.

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:05.749
Aren't you scared...

00:12:06.483 --> 00:12:08.285
about meeting strangers like that?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.254
Hey.

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:13.223
Even if I look like I live carelessly,

00:12:13.223 --> 00:12:14.892
I'm actually very thorough.

00:12:15.392 --> 00:12:18.495
I check their background in advance,
and figure out their personality.

00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:19.496
I do all of that.

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:21.599
And what else do you check?

00:12:21.832 --> 00:12:22.967
Next is...

00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:24.868
their face.

00:12:26.003 --> 00:12:27.705
So if they're ugly, you won't meet them?

00:12:27.972 --> 00:12:31.075
Honestly,
you can chat endlessly in writing,

00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:32.676
but meeting in person is
completely different.

00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:36.413
I see.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.187
My concern these days is...

00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.124
putting sincerity into my songs.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.828
"If you speak in the tongues of men
or of angels,

00:12:51.528 --> 00:12:55.699
but do not have love,
I am only a clanging cymbal."

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.402
Do you know this saying?

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.438
Not becoming a cymbal.

00:13:01.438 --> 00:13:03.941
That's my goal.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.511
When I played you the song I made before,

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:10.147
you said that for a song Ha Rin made,

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:13.584
it felt a little sad.

00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:16.253
Hearing that,

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.889
it felt like my head cleared.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.692
Like I'd found a clue...

00:13:21.692 --> 00:13:23.961
to escaping being a cymbal.

00:13:24.828 --> 00:13:28.165
So I tried making a new song.

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:31.235
Would you listen to it?

00:13:31.235 --> 00:13:32.303
(Send)

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.980
With my eyes closed

00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:20.851
Following the path already written

00:14:22.186 --> 00:14:27.625
I try walking toward you

00:14:30.861 --> 00:14:33.364
With every single letter

00:14:35.232 --> 00:14:38.102
The feelings come through

00:14:39.603 --> 00:14:44.775
With steps that never end

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:52.750
Slowly, right now, toward you

00:14:53.717 --> 00:14:57.588
In every way

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.893
No matter what we are

00:15:03.794 --> 00:15:07.564
We'll stay as one through love

00:15:11.268 --> 00:15:15.139
Someone that's true

00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:20.210
I'll be the one for you

00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:28.052
Forever, and I will promise you

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.474
I've been thinking about it,

00:15:51.942 --> 00:15:55.379
and I think I really enjoy
talking with you, Ji Eum.

00:15:58.048 --> 00:15:59.883
So I worked up a bit of courage.

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:08.926
This is my messenger ID.

00:16:10.961 --> 00:16:14.198
I thought asking for your number
might feel like too much.

00:16:16.967 --> 00:16:19.236
It's okay if you don't want to.

00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:23.507
We can keep talking by email
like we are now.

00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:30.781
Think it over and reach out if you'd like.

00:16:39.723 --> 00:16:40.691
It's hot.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:49.934
P.S.

00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:54.872
It'll be way more fun than emailing.

00:16:55.739 --> 00:16:56.807
I really mean it.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:26.003
You should silence your phone
in the library.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.137
What are you saying?

00:17:35.112 --> 00:17:36.580
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

00:17:43.287 --> 00:17:45.189
Hi, Mr. Cymbals.

00:17:51.562 --> 00:17:52.329
Sorry.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.034
It's here.

00:18:03.474 --> 00:18:06.644
(Park Yoo Shin)

00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:10.447
Yes! I'm the cymbal who's trying his best.

00:18:10.447 --> 00:18:11.682
Your drink is ready.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.018
Thank you.

00:18:16.086 --> 00:18:18.322
At this hour, you may be at work.

00:18:19.323 --> 00:18:21.058
If you don't mind me asking,

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.327
what do you do?

00:18:27.831 --> 00:18:29.166
I work at an arboretum.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.172
Have you always liked plants?

00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.542
They felt familiar to me.

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:40.711
My father worked in horticulture.

00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:45.382
What about you, Yoo Shin?

00:18:45.382 --> 00:18:47.518
When did you start doing music?

00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:52.790
I decided in middle school.

00:18:53.524 --> 00:18:55.693
I once went to karaoke with my parents.

00:18:56.794 --> 00:18:58.462
When my mom sang,

00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:02.766
my dad looked at her
like a boy with a crush.

00:19:03.534 --> 00:19:04.735
That's when it started.

00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:25.389
What about you?

00:19:26.023 --> 00:19:27.258
What do you do in your free time?

00:19:30.527 --> 00:19:32.096
I go out to eat good food.

00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:34.999
What do you like?

00:19:36.734 --> 00:19:37.801
Spicy rice cakes.

00:19:38.535 --> 00:19:41.338
I once went all the way to Busan
just for them.

00:19:42.573 --> 00:19:43.707
By train?

00:19:43.707 --> 00:19:44.742
By train.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.580
Was there a guy who made
your heart flutter sitting next to you?

00:20:00.057 --> 00:20:02.126
Unfortunately, no.

00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:05.129
Sounds like you were hoping
there might be.

00:20:06.931 --> 00:20:07.932
A little.

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:11.402
More like, "That'd be nice."

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.805
I've always dreamed...

00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:17.875
that the woman sitting next to me...

00:20:18.142 --> 00:20:20.444
would be my intensely fated destiny.

00:20:21.879 --> 00:20:23.280
Does it have to be that intense?

00:20:23.948 --> 00:20:26.617
Yes, an ordinary destiny won't do.

00:20:26.617 --> 00:20:28.319
I'm a hardcore believer in destiny.

00:20:29.987 --> 00:20:33.324
I'll keep that in mind,
Mr. Hardcore-Destiny Cymbals.

00:20:41.298 --> 00:20:42.833
When do you think it started for us?

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:47.738
If even this conversation right now...

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:50.908
is part of some great current of fate,

00:20:55.112 --> 00:20:56.947
when did it begin?

00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.117
Well,

00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:03.487
when do you think?

00:21:07.858 --> 00:21:08.726
At first,

00:21:09.627 --> 00:21:12.296
I thought it started when I emailed you.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.500
But the more I thought about it,

00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:19.236
I think it goes back even further.

00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:23.741
From when you made the song?

00:21:24.608 --> 00:21:25.509
No.

00:21:26.877 --> 00:21:28.712
From when you wrote the novel.

00:21:30.447 --> 00:21:31.882
If that novel hadn't existed,

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.852
none of this would have happened.

00:21:38.656 --> 00:21:39.623
Then,

00:21:41.325 --> 00:21:43.727
I guess I'm the one who reached out first.

00:21:45.462 --> 00:21:46.497
And you did it...

00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:49.934
with dreamlike tenderness.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:11.288
(And you did it
with dreamlike tenderness.)

00:22:13.023 --> 00:22:14.959
Seems like he doesn't realize...

00:22:16.026 --> 00:22:17.194
that he's the more dreamlike one.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.799
(The sentences that made me)

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:24.101
(Novel study notes)

00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:26.136
(Practice drafts notebook)

00:22:32.409 --> 00:22:35.179
(AI columbarium?)

00:22:38.182 --> 00:22:39.883
(City-unfamiliar-both strange and new)

00:22:39.883 --> 00:22:41.585
(City-loneliness-
but is everyone lonely in the city?)

00:23:28.832 --> 00:23:32.403
Receiving encouragement
from someone I've never met.

00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:37.174
Talking about movies we love.

00:23:38.409 --> 00:23:40.811
Telling each other what we ate today.

00:23:43.747 --> 00:23:45.649
Sharing hints we never meant to give,

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:49.119
and answers we never even asked for.

00:23:52.022 --> 00:23:55.092
Then saying, "Let's talk more tomorrow."

00:23:55.859 --> 00:23:57.328
Tomorrow.

00:23:58.062 --> 00:24:01.899
And like that, day by day, we became
part of each other's everyday lives.

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:04.235
Did you get off work?

00:24:04.935 --> 00:24:06.670
I'm trying out being a working adult
right now.

00:24:07.805 --> 00:24:09.640
Why try out such a harsh trial?

00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:21.685
How does that work?

00:24:23.087 --> 00:24:24.521
You know how in dramas,

00:24:25.322 --> 00:24:28.626
when the leads are troubled
or in a serious situation,

00:24:29.493 --> 00:24:31.462
they drink coffee on a rooftop...

00:24:31.462 --> 00:24:32.997
and suddenly everything clears up,

00:24:34.331 --> 00:24:35.699
and the situation turns around?

00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:42.206
I'm trying that out...

00:24:42.206 --> 00:24:43.674
to see if it works for me too.

00:24:48.145 --> 00:24:49.413
Is something wrong?

00:24:51.882 --> 00:24:53.350
Nothing serious,

00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:55.753
but there's something
I've been worrying about for a while,

00:24:55.753 --> 00:24:56.987
and it's quite frustrating.

00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:01.425
What do you do when you're worried?

00:25:04.995 --> 00:25:07.398
I think I just act first.

00:25:08.265 --> 00:25:10.968
Whatever I'm thinking,
"Should I try this?"

00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:12.303
I just do it.

00:25:12.903 --> 00:25:16.240
You have to act first
to fix things or clean them up.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.208
That's how you move on to the next stage.

00:25:19.877 --> 00:25:23.180
If there's something floating around
in your head, Yoo Shin,

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.815
just go for it.

00:25:27.585 --> 00:25:29.486
Just go for it.

00:25:33.257 --> 00:25:34.458
Go for it.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.432
(I'm ready too.)

00:25:41.432 --> 00:25:42.967
(I think I can start again.)

00:25:56.213 --> 00:25:57.815
Do you want to talk on the phone?

00:25:58.349 --> 00:25:59.383
I'll wait.

00:26:31.081 --> 00:26:32.316
(Jung Ji Eum)

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.351
Hi.

00:26:44.628 --> 00:26:47.765
I wasn't expecting a video call.

00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:50.167
Now that I think about it,

00:26:50.167 --> 00:26:52.169
I know what you look like, Yoo Shin,
but you don't.

00:27:10.721 --> 00:27:12.022
You're right, Ji Eum.

00:27:13.857 --> 00:27:17.361
Even if it fails,
just going for it head-on...

00:27:18.696 --> 00:27:19.830
seems like the right choice.

00:27:21.865 --> 00:27:23.767
Can I ask what you're planning to do?

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.639
I want to find out...

00:27:30.507 --> 00:27:31.642
whether I'm still just a cymbal or not.

00:27:34.511 --> 00:27:35.446
Sounds good.

00:27:37.448 --> 00:27:39.516
Whether you're a cymbal or an angel,

00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:41.619
I'll do my best to find out.

00:27:44.188 --> 00:27:45.522
What do I need to do?

00:27:51.095 --> 00:27:52.663
I made a song...

00:27:53.764 --> 00:27:55.099
out of the things we talked about.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.501
I'll play it for you.

00:28:26.196 --> 00:28:28.299
Love with you

00:28:29.867 --> 00:28:33.304
Wherever you go, come with you

00:28:35.372 --> 00:28:39.176
Always by your side

00:28:40.477 --> 00:28:44.014
Till the end of everything

00:28:46.984 --> 00:28:49.119
Love with you

00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:54.391
Wherever you are, come with you

00:28:56.093 --> 00:29:00.197
Stay close by your side

00:29:01.398 --> 00:29:05.169
Till the end of everything

00:29:06.637 --> 00:29:09.740
Oh, I need you

00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:16.213
'Cause all my love is with you

00:29:17.114 --> 00:29:21.085
Thinking of you

00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:26.357
Thinking of you

00:29:27.191 --> 00:29:31.595
I'm thinking of you

00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:38.769
I'm thinking of you

00:30:03.327 --> 00:30:04.261
Do you...

00:30:05.462 --> 00:30:06.697
want to go on a trip with me?

00:30:12.202 --> 00:30:13.671
I want to see the ocean,

00:30:15.005 --> 00:30:17.141
and I'm craving spicy rice cakes too.

00:30:20.644 --> 00:30:21.612
Then,

00:30:23.013 --> 00:30:24.415
by train?

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.985
By train.

00:30:32.256 --> 00:30:33.223
Would it be okay...

00:30:34.758 --> 00:30:36.427
if I sat next to you?

00:30:42.433 --> 00:30:45.436
Doesn't that sound fun? Intensely.

00:30:48.906 --> 00:30:49.907
Then,

00:30:51.542 --> 00:30:53.244
three hours from now...

00:30:53.244 --> 00:30:54.111
One hour.

00:30:56.614 --> 00:30:57.881
I mean,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.586
if it takes too long,
you might regret it for no reason,

00:31:02.586 --> 00:31:05.789
and then start hesitating,
wondering if you should go at all.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.025
So what I'm saying is...

00:31:08.025 --> 00:31:08.892
Okay.

00:31:11.595 --> 00:31:12.496
One hour.

00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:17.868
Let's meet at Seoul Station in one hour.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:20.838
Okay.

00:31:21.105 --> 00:31:22.172
Don't be late.

00:31:23.741 --> 00:31:24.608
Okay.

00:31:37.554 --> 00:31:39.490
(Video call ends)

00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:04.515
Taxi.

00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:07.318
Taxi.

00:32:08.018 --> 00:32:08.919
Taxi.

00:32:14.091 --> 00:32:15.192
Hello. To Seoul Station, please.

00:32:19.129 --> 00:32:20.164
Looking back,

00:32:20.898 --> 00:32:23.534
it was the most impulsive choice
of my life.

00:32:26.303 --> 00:32:27.504
So much so that I wondered...

00:32:27.504 --> 00:32:30.441
if excitement had completely
short-circuited my brain.

00:32:36.947 --> 00:32:39.950
It was, quite literally, nothing but love.

00:32:42.286 --> 00:32:44.622
It suddenly rushed out from the alley.

00:32:49.893 --> 00:32:51.729
Sir, I'll get off here.

00:33:19.757 --> 00:33:23.260
Just as I'd hoped, a trend was beginning.

00:33:38.309 --> 00:33:41.145
A huge trend
that existed only between the two of us.

00:33:48.586 --> 00:33:49.753
I'm sorry.

00:34:30.995 --> 00:34:31.862
Hi.

00:34:32.696 --> 00:34:33.664
Angel.

00:34:47.177 --> 00:34:50.981
(Love conquers all.)

00:34:50.981 --> 00:34:55.753
- (So let us believe in love too.
- Vergilius)

00:35:51.175 --> 00:35:53.410
What do you think love is?

00:35:57.481 --> 00:35:58.349
That was unexpected.

00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:59.383
- You go first.
- You go first.

00:35:59.383 --> 00:36:00.718
I said it first, so you go.

00:36:00.718 --> 00:36:01.852
You go first.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.556
They're in love.

00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:07.391
Should we ask AI?

00:36:08.158 --> 00:36:09.126
Yeah.

00:36:09.426 --> 00:36:10.894
Love is...

00:36:12.329 --> 00:36:14.698
Wait, I think I left the gas stove on.

00:36:15.566 --> 00:36:16.934
One, two, three.

00:36:16.934 --> 00:36:17.868
- Number of stars.
- Number of stars.

00:36:18.802 --> 00:36:20.871
I thought we wouldn't match again.

00:36:24.942 --> 00:36:26.176
Why are your hands shaking?

00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:30.848
Hey, Kim Min Ji.

00:36:32.783 --> 00:36:33.817
Love?

00:36:34.451 --> 00:36:37.821
Oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin.

00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:40.691
Some kind of wild cocktail
of these hormones, I think.

00:36:43.294 --> 00:36:44.395
Being together.

00:36:46.096 --> 00:36:48.032
Showing someone your weaknesses.

00:36:48.032 --> 00:36:50.134
For me, love is...

00:36:52.369 --> 00:36:54.838
I suddenly feel like crying.

00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:56.674
Wait, sorry.

00:36:58.976 --> 00:36:59.977
It's...

00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:04.114
about being someone's Sailor Moon.

00:37:04.114 --> 00:37:06.717
Realizing that the other person...

00:37:06.984 --> 00:37:08.085
is someone who truly sparkles.

00:37:08.085 --> 00:37:10.054
Wanting to see them every day.

00:37:10.421 --> 00:37:11.722
When you're worn out and exhausted,

00:37:11.722 --> 00:37:14.158
just thinking of them brings comfort.

00:37:14.158 --> 00:37:17.328
This good food and these warm words.

00:37:17.328 --> 00:37:18.562
Isn't that enough?

00:37:18.562 --> 00:37:22.499
Something you hope you'll win
at least once in life,

00:37:22.499 --> 00:37:23.667
like a housing lottery.

00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:25.002
Something that sweeps in...

00:37:26.036 --> 00:37:28.138
and carries you away helplessly,

00:37:28.973 --> 00:37:30.107
yet none of it...

00:37:30.908 --> 00:37:32.443
feels unpleasant at all.

00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:37.114
Are you in love
with the person next to you?

00:37:38.682 --> 00:37:40.284
Love, my foot.

00:37:40.284 --> 00:37:42.019
I was in love.

00:37:42.019 --> 00:37:44.188
I was, once.

00:37:44.188 --> 00:37:46.790
I want to stab
those rose-colored glasses...

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.492
I was wearing back then.

00:37:48.492 --> 00:37:50.094
Still, don't stab. It hurts.

00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:53.230
Someday,

00:37:54.798 --> 00:37:56.333
I hope I can love again.

00:37:59.536 --> 00:38:00.537
Very much.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.174
Yes.

00:38:09.446 --> 00:38:10.547
Interview over.

00:38:11.415 --> 00:38:13.350
You worked so hard, even on the interview.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.719
I'm really looking forward
to your new novel.

00:38:16.487 --> 00:38:17.988
Me too.

00:38:20.224 --> 00:38:21.425
Should we turn it off now?

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.841
What will the title be?

00:38:29.842 --> 00:38:32.950
"Play Your Love."

00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:34.098
"Love : Track."

00:38:34.099 --> 00:38:37.228
(Love : Track)

00:38:37.229 --> 00:38:39.229
