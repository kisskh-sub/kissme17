00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.510
So, this is the sunlight
of the Immortal Realm.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.960
One day, we'll have it, too.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.790
The Immortal Realm is so great.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.630
Yeah.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.680
Your Grace!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.040
Your Grace, something's wrong!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
The demon soldiers have gone berserk!

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.590
We were celebrating

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.710
when brothers in the camp
suddenly turned ghost-like

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.920
and attacked demons

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.070
just like him.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.920
How can this be?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.640
We've never known

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.400
such a sickness.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.220
Could it be some poison

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.710
that the immortals left behind?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.480
Feng Tian is treacherous.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.960
A century ago,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.640
when you were sealed,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230
he also poisoned us.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.300
You said the demons
would only grow frenzied.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.340
Why do they suffer from corpse syndrome?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.480
Did you do this?

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.790
Show yourself!

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.190
The frenzy has pros and cons;

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.800
I am also a demon.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.430
Why would I betray the demon clan?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.520
It had better be so.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.840
Our great cause is done;

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.520
I won't let you touch
the remaining troops.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.550
Spare me, Ms. Luo!

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.310
I only wish to complete
my transformation.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.630
I ask nothing more!

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.870
Consider this a small warning.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.310
Next time,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.240
your soul will be scattered.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.940
In two days,
the immortals will be executed.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.000
Their emotions will be plenty
for you to grow.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.240
But promise me:

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.520
Once you fully take shape,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.030
you will never set foot
in either realm again.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.430
(The Spirit Sensor
and the soul-devouring aura)

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.280
(actually made Jie Chuan a Demon Deity.)

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.190
(Fortunately, I've plucked and devoured)

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.030
(his threads of love.)

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.870
(Jie Chuan loves Ji Li deeply.)

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.400
(His threads
will surely boost my power.)

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.310
Luo Cha,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.630
I'm eternal.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.710
Since you're so stupid,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.080
I'll claim both realms.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.080
Why...

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960
Why has it come to this?

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.080
Jie Chuan's been lying to me.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.600
You were the one who betrayed me.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.680
The immortals poisoned the demons.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.560
Yet you always look so innocent.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.750
You're better than me.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.360
Your tender act

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.510
was flawless.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.480
You used such a scheme

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.950
to storm the Immortal Realm.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.310
I'm outplayed.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.270
If you want to kill me,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.240
why save me?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.470
Forget it.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
What's the point of asking now?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.310
On the day of the festival,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.270
I already stumbled upon the truth.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.000
The festival?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.070
I decorated the Demon Palace.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.680
What truth could you have found?

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.070
What drama are you staging?

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.680
You knew everything.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.000
Were you trying to lure my master,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.240
or to revive Jin Li?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.310
I only regret

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.630
that I didn't kill you
when I had the chance.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.390
(Why does my heart ache?)

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.750
(Why does she still stir my pity?)

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.480
(I never plotted her death,)

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.510
(nor sought to resurrect Jin Li.)

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.360
(What really happened)

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.480
(at the festival?)

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.510
Greetings, Your Grace.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.960
Rise.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.160
What shall we do

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.870
with these immortals?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Kill them all.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.270
No!

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.560
You can't.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.510
I had almost forgotten you.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.000
Everyone,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.480
in this demon victory,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.390
someone also helped us.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.040
I must reward her.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.360
Had Ji Li

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.160
not told me the secret

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.040
to breaking the immortal barrier,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.180
how could demon legions

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.630
have taken it so easily?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.870
When Feng Tian fled,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.190
he left you behind.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.310
Since none of you will bow
to demon rule,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.390
from this day on,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.560
you'll be under Ji Li's command.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.360
Kneel!

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.150
No!

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.390
Kneel! Kneel!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.000
No! No!

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.840
Ji Li,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.680
I offer to share this throne

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.950
with you.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.750
Don't you like it?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.160
Why not

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.190
just kill me?

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.600
Master,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.750
why have you come?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.480
If I hadn't,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.950
was I to watch you die here?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.680
(What is Feng Tian's conspiracy?)

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.190
(I'll test it and see.)

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.030
(The frenzy rage has nothing
to do with Feng Tian.)

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.440
(There's a traitor among the demons.)

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.870
(Ji Li said)

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.150
(she heard my plan that day
in Wasteland.)

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.750
(Who impersonated me?)

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.780
The immortals didn't cause
the frenzy rage;

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.800
I will no longer

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.200
harm them.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.270
From now on,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.390
Ji Li shall heal

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.320
wounded demon soldiers

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.670
until the last

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.510
of my troops is restored.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.480
(What is this frenzy rage?)

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.630
Ji Li!

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.490
Aren't you afraid of catching it?

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.550
The Immortal Realm...

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.480
(Spirit Sensor alone)

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.910
(could never make me a Demon Deity.)

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.080
(Could I)

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.080
(be carrying the soul-devouring aura?)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.790
(Who is this demon traitor?)

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.720
(Who has harmed both my people)

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.480
(and Ji Li's heart?)

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.150
Your tender act

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.390
was flawless.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.790
You used such a scheme

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.360
to storm the Immortal Realm.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.960
I'm outplayed.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.080
This...

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.750
This is Jie Chuan's threads of love.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.750
As expected of the Demon Sovereign.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.960
The threads that were ripped out
have grown back.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.080
Why does the frenzy rage
also show this red line?

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.270
Immortals with the soul-devouring aura

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.200
also have a red line on the wrist,

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.320
running straight to the heart.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.480
Ji Li?

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.990
Ji Li?

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.870
Ying Ge,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.040
are you saying

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.150
immortals and demons show
the same symptom?

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.230
Exactly.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.120
That day in the cave, I heard

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.910
the great war was staged

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.200
so immortals would catch this sickness.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.390
If the man in the cave was Jie Chuan,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.790
why are demons infected too?

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.790
Could the Demon Sovereign

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.120
have engineered his own downfall?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.720
He doesn't seem that stupid.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.750
Jin Li,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.270
wait for me.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.480
The one in the cave wasn't Jie Chuan.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.030
His hands were uninjured.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.510
I've been duped.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.440
Someone is driving us apart.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.270
Why didn't he explain?

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.750
Maybe

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.390
he wanted to protect me.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.390
Protect you?

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.960
What are you two plotting?

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.630
We were talking about you.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.390
About how you betrayed us,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.720
always acting crazy.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.160
Let's go.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.750
Ji Li.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.670
So what if I am the traitor?

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.600
Now I can visit Hong Zhua every day.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.320
Compared to before,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.150
when his gaze rested only on you,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.510
this life

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.200
is sweet indeed.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.230
Huan Zhen,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.030
do you only care

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.360
about who Master belongs to

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.600
instead of what he truly wants?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.630
I love him.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.960
He must belong to me

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.080
and see only me.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200
As for the rest,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.200
why trouble myself?

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.390
That isn't love;

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.670
it's possession.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.510
To love someone

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.550
is harder than owning them.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.560
Love

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.270
is trying something you dislike

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.870
because it pleases them.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.990
Love

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.750
is walking a rough road

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.870
beside them to the end.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.200
- Love is sacrificing yourself
- (Ji Li.)

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.080
to shield the one you love.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.550
Love overcomes

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.600
all obstacles between you.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.270
Love is when you're aching inside,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.080
you're still worrying over them.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.150
Love is being weak yourself

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.550
yet giving everything

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.600
for them,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.670
no matter the cost.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.270
I've devoured immortal

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.120
and demon power.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.390
Jie Chuan's threads of love

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.440
are truly potent.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.270
At last, I've taken human shape.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.630
Jie Chuan is so emotional
and weak today.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.870
What a perfect chance.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.390
As expected,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.240
the deeper your love for her,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.080
the easier my blade slides in.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.580
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.540
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.260
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.580
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.940
♪You come to me in every way♪

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:54.060
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.020
♪All my best years were for you♪

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:07.820
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:15.340
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:22.460
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.340
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:34.940
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
