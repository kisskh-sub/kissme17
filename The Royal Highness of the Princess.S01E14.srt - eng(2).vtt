WEBVTT

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.519
Xixi, you need to pull yourself together.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.480
We must live on, carrying Ru Feng's share...

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:48.760
...and live happily.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.159
Don't worry, Princess. I'm fine now.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.640
I told His Majesty your dementia is cured.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.359
Only your memories haven't returned yet.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.159
Recently, His Majesty ordered me...

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.640
...to purge Prince Ning's remaining forces.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.959
I'm afraid I can't visit the palace often.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.000
You can't enter the palace?

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.480
Why are you telling me this specifically?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.639
What about the mysterious person?

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.080
Any discoveries?

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.080
I've already sent He Lianchen to investigate.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.960
If there's any news...

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.960
...I'll tell you.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.560
Then I'll return to the palace first.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.879
Princess...

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.080
Lord Yuwen is treating you so differently now.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.960
Could he have ulterior motives?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.879
What could he possibly want from me?

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.520
Your servant can't figure it out either.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840
Anyway, I think...

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.520
...Young Master Meng is your perfect match.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.120
Last time he visited you at Lord Yuwen's villa,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.479
I noticed his eyes were only on you.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.639
Enough.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.120
Stop playing matchmaker for me.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.719
Meng Shaojue is my friend.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:46.680
What's wrong with being friends?

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.400
Friends can't...

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.240
Young Master Meng!

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.919
I finally waited for your return.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.439
What are you doing here?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520
Zixiu brought me here.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.719
He's probably gone to find the Fourth Princess now.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.599
I've already heard about Prince Ning's matter.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.639
Are you alright?

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.240
I'm fine.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.199
It's just Ru Feng...

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.639
Alright, let's not talk about this.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.520
Why didn't Yinglu come with you?

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.159
Naturally, because I wanted to be alone with you.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.000
Can you be serious for once?

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.000
If you miss her...

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.520
...you can visit the Meng residence anytime.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.439
Father!

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.400
Good, good, good.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.800
It seems Minister Yuwen...

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800
...truly found someone to cure your dementia.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.719
I've worried you, Father.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.879
I've sent some precious medicinal herbs...

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.560
...to your palace.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.199
You've just regained your senses.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.360
You must rest and recuperate properly.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.960
Thank you, Father.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.280
By the way, Father...

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.319
...let me introduce you.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.360
This is Grand Preceptor Meng's son, Meng Shaojue.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.319
He's a friend I made...

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.000
...while receiving treatment outside the palace.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.080
If I remember correctly...

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.240
...since the Palace Examination five years ago...

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.920
...I haven't seen you again.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.279
Your Majesty still remembers this commoner?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.839
This commoner is deeply honored and humbled.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.079
I don't sense any humility from you.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:25.959
To dare, after the Palace Examination...

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.959
...to publicly refuse an official post...

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.079
You are the first in Yunmi to do so.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.759
Father...

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.279
A Lan is a bit tired.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.120
Then hurry back and rest.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.720
I have matters to attend to.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.680
I'll visit you later.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.000
Shao Jue...

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.279
Why did you refuse to become an official?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.920
My temperament isn't suited for officialdom.

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.600
Then why did you take the imperial exams?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.759
Did your father force you?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.040
In this world...

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.639
...no one can force me to do what I don't wish.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.000
But if you wanted me to do something...

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.879
...even if it meant scaling a mountain of blades or crossing a sea of fire...

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.800
...I would gladly do it.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.319
Here we go again.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.000
My late mother's wish...

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.560
...was for me to achieve top honors in the exams.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:29.319
By the way...

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.079
The Flower Festival is approaching.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.800
The peach blossoms outside the city are in full bloom.

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.360
Yinglu is clamoring to go for an outing.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.720
Why doesn't A Lan come with us?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.759
Alright.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.680
Perfect timing.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.600
I brought Yinglu a few martial arts manuals.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600
I'll give them to her then.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.199
Is that Seventh Cousin?

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.519
That's how cheesy dramas always play out.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.560
"I like you."

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.399
"You like me too."

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.800
"But I just won't tell you."

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.800
Shao Jue...

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.000
Tell me...

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.240
...Seventh Cousin clearly likes Royal Sister.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.720
Why won't he tell her?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.639
Perhaps Zixiu...

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.120
...feels he's not worthy of the Fourth Princess.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.639
What nonsense about being worthy or not!

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.120
It only depends on whether one is brave enough.

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:17.600
How about...

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.680
...we give him a helping hand?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.319
Do you have any good ideas?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.199
Didn't you just say...

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.839
...the peach grove outside the city is in full bloom?

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.360
If we invite Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin...

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.079
...to admire the flowers together...

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.279
The fine wine Shao Jue sent...

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.720
...is especially fragrant.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:54.480
Have a taste.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.120
It really is good.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.759
Here, Seventh Cousin.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.600
Why did you suddenly ask us to accompany you flower-viewing?

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.920
Isn't it all for your "peach blossom luck"?

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.480
What?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.839
Nothing.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.120
Shao Jue said the scenery here is exceptionally beautiful.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.639
He invited everyone to admire the flowers and taste the wine.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.040
It's getting late.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.439
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.439
I'll go check.

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.240
You two go ahead and wait for me.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.959
I'll be right back.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:46.800
Seventh Cousin! A Zi!

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160
Let's wait for A Lan over there.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.199
It's all set.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.439
As you instructed...

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.319
...the pit is lined with thick grass.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.839
I guarantee they won't get hurt.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.519
Are you alright, A Zi?

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.399
I'm fine.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.040
I'll get you out.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.960
I can't use my inner force.

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:35.919
This...

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.799
Sorry about this, Royal Sister.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.759
I put something in the wine.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.440
There's also some in the pit.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.080
If I heard correctly just now,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600
the one who screamed was

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080
Seventh Cousin.

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:15.519
Zixiu's courage

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.159
is not even as good as Fourth Princess's.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.159
The male and female leads falling into a trap together

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.799
is actually an excellent way to foster feelings.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.480
Sorry, A Zi.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.240
It's fine.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.799
Big Brother, why are you here?

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.840
You...

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.600
Where are A Lan and Meng Shaojue?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:48.960
I don't know.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.480
Get us out first, hurry!

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.639
Yuwen Rui!

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:56.639
Let's go.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.919
Big Brother! Big Brother!

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.320
I...

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.759
He... he just left like that?

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:19.720
Why is Yuwen Rui here?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.480
He showed up at such a critical moment.

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:25.240
Hold on tight.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.200
Wait, why are we running?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.279
I've never seen Lord Yuwen so flustered.

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:41.799
How interesting.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.639
I'm saying, can you two

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.440
stop playing this game of cat and mouse?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.600
Your Lordship's lightness skill is indeed impressive.

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:36.519
Why are you here?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.120
I heard you and...

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:45.200
I heard you came here to admire flowers and taste wine.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:46.919
What admiring flowers and tasting wine?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.279
I wanted to use this opportunity

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.159
to properly matchmake Seventh Cousin and Royal Sister.

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.240
Who knew you'd show up halfway through?

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:55.519
And I ruined your little scheme.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.080
Your Lordship has ruined

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:04.240
more than just this one scheme.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.600
I'm taking you back to the palace.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.679
A Lan and I haven't admired the flowers or tasted wine yet.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.039
Let go.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.159
Zixiu and Fourth Princess

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.399
seem to still be waiting for you in the trap.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.240
You go rescue them first.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.279
Don't say you saw us.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.720
Shao Jue and I will be over shortly.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.639
Let's go.

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:02.159
Help!

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.519
Someone save us!

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.720
Help!

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.159
Save... Big Brother!

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:10.799
Big Cousin!

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:11.559
You're finally here!

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.159
My throat is almost hoarse from shouting.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.799
I thought you weren't coming.

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:20.200
Come on up.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:21.519
Quick, quick, quick, A Zi!

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.200
Okay.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.039
Take it slow.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.679
Are you alright?

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:32.120
I'm fine.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.039
Why can't A Zi even use her inner force?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.320
Perhaps someone sprinkled powder in the trap.

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:42.240
What happened here?

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.679
Are you two okay?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.360
We're fine.

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:46.080
We accidentally fell into a pit just now.

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:50.000
Why are you here too?

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.200
To admire the flowers together.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:53.440
This place is suspicious.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200
We should return to the palace sooner rather than later.

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.799
Right, right, let's hurry and leave.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.799
Don't accidentally fall into another trap.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.440
Let's wait until the Flower Festival

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.000
to admire flowers and taste wine together in the palace.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.720
Let's go.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.559
Shao Jue.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.799
In previous years, I never saw you attend the Flower Festival.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.000
Aren't you coming this year either?

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:16.919
With A Lan here,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.360
I must go this year.

00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:22.840
What talent is A Lan planning

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.000
to display at the Flower Festival Banquet?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.320
Display a talent?

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:30.480
A Lan probably doesn't remember.

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.159
Her Majesty the Empress holds

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.279
a Flower Festival Banquet every year.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.480
She invites the children of noble families

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.279
to admire flowers and taste wine together,

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:39.799
get to know each other,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.559
and compete in talents.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.639
I see.

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:44.279
A large-scale matchmaking event.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.240
I heard the prize for this year's banquet

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.080
is a pair of white jade mandarin ducks.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:49.480
Rumor has it they were

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.639
the love tokens of Emperor Yunze and his empress.

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:52.720
They're extremely valuable.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.120
Do you want them?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.639
I'll win them for you.

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:02.600
No need to trouble yourself.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.039
Let's go.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:09.639
Perhaps we can use the Flower Festival Banquet to give them a boost.

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:10.840
What do you think?

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:11.960
I think we can.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.279
Watch your step.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.759
Royal Sister.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.120
What talent are you planning to display?

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.399
Sword dancing.

00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:26.559
Any chance of winning?

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:28.799
A Zi sword dances every year,

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:30.840
but she only won the top prize the first year.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.799
I'll think of a way.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.799
We...

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.159
will definitely win those white jade mandarin ducks.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.000
Tomorrow, all of you come to Yunxi Palace.

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:43.600
Bring Yinglu too.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.480
I had Xiao Lizi make some inquiries.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:53.840
At this Flower Festival Banquet,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.960
no one is performing a play.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.960
This is a storybook I adapted myself.

00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:58.279
We'll perform it ourselves.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.159
What does "Version 2.0" mean?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.480
It means the second version.

00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:08.919
It's a tragic yet beautiful love story.

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:11.039
I specifically added scenes where

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:14.080
the male and female leads play the zither together, sword dance,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.360
paint, and compose poetry.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.080
Varied talents combined with a tragic love story

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:23.759
are sure to amaze everyone.

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:25.080
Not bad, not bad.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.000
Others either play the zither

00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:28.000
or sword dance.

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:30.200
We have a bit of everything.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.679
This time, we're sure to win the top prize.

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.039
Then you

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:44.320
plan to help Zixiu and Fourth Princess?

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.559
You'll find out in a moment.

00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:52.440
Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:53.960
will play the leads in the opera,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.360
namely, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.639
Why me and A Zi?

00:16:58.639 --> 00:16:59.759
If you don't want to act,

00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:00.399
you can quit.

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:05.440
ShaoJue and Yinglu

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.240
can play the page boy and maid, okay?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.119
This play

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.400
relies heavily on the chemistry

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.759
and rapport between the leads.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.559
Whether it's performed well

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.640
depends entirely on Seventh Cousin and Royal Sister.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.319
You two try a few scenes first

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.480
to build some rapport.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:24.920
Coincidentally,

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:27.039
there's a Cuju scene at the academy

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.279
where Liang Shanbo accidentally discovers

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:30.200
Zhu Yingtai's true gender.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.519
So, we

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.839
will try this scene first.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.759
Come on, everyone, listen up!

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:43.480
No using inner force or anything in today's match.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.079
Will we need this many people on stage later?

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:51.200
We'll see how it looks first.

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:54.000
Anyway, let's have a serious match today.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.079
I will win.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.640
Be careful.

00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:04.839
Control your strength,

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:05.759
don't hurt anyone.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.720
Don't worry,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.920
I know my limits.

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:07.039
Royal Sister,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.000
your chance to be the hero saving the beauty is here.

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:35.440
Is Royal Sister's competitive spirit that strong?

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.640
Fourth Princess has never lost a Cuju match.

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:42.079
Seventh Cousin, I'm really sorry for you.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.400
I quit, I quit!

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.720
Seventh Cousin, are you okay?

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:51.000
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:00.039
Looks like the hero-saving-beauty plan is a bust.

00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:03.200
As expected of my Royal Sister,

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:04.720
a true heroine among women.

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:07.559
Chief Grand Secretary,

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:09.559
the Princess and Lord Meng are here.

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:13.319
What are you discussing that requires such closeness?

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.359
Nothing.

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:22.200
Let's call it a day for now.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.240
But the winner hasn't been decided yet.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.119
Seventh Cousin is in this state,

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:27.680
he probably doesn't want to continue.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.880
Let's just disband, disband.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.119
Then let's disband.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.559
On behalf of Zixiu,

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:43.599
Okay.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.359
Why do I feel

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.240
they're not kicking a ball,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.839
One to zero.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:50.839
Lord Yuwen seems to have lost, right?

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:54.359
Yes, yes, yes.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:55.480
That's about enough now.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.240
It's time to end this.

00:21:59.319 --> 00:21:59.799
A Lan,

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:01.319
I think this act

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:02.960
is not suitable for the Flower Festival Banquet.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.720
Of course it's not suitable.

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:05.119
I already plan to cut it.

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:08.480
Everyone, go home today and familiarize yourselves with the script.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.240
Tomorrow,

00:22:09.359 --> 00:22:10.160
we'll have our official rehearsal.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.480
You... are in a bad mood.

00:22:20.359 --> 00:22:21.000
I'm perfectly fine.

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:27.799
Lately, you've been spending time

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:28.799
with Meng Shaojue every day.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.519
He's helping me matchmake Seventh Cousin and Royal Sister.

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:32.960
Naturally, we have to meet often.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:35.759
He certainly has a lot of free time.

00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:38.440
What exactly is going on between you and Shaojue?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.160
It's like you have some deep-seated grudge.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.240
Nothing.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.119
Stay away from him from now on.

00:22:44.559 --> 00:22:45.880
Seventh Cousin is right.

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:48.960
You and Shaojue should interact more.

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:50.640
Maybe you'll become good brothers.

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:53.039
Don't mention him in front of me again.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.599
Weren't you the one who brought him up first?

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.759
I'll be quite busy in the coming days.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.119
I'll come see you again in a while.

00:23:04.599 --> 00:23:05.519
You focus on your business.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.599
No need to visit me for no reason.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.960
If you want to see me,

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:14.200
use this firework as a signal.

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.440
Why would I want to see you?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.599
Aren't you going inside?

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:40.720
This line...

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:45.519
A Lan,

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:48.440
if we perform well,

00:23:49.359 --> 00:23:50.440
can we really win first place?

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.759
Don't worry, Royal Sister.

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:53.880
I know you want to help Seventh Cousin

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.839
win the White Jade Mandarin Ducks.

00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:55.920
Leave it all to me.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.240
Ma Wencai is such a darn scoundrel, isn't he?

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:04.119
Who will play him?

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.119
His part isn't big anyway.

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:07.519
We can just find someone random.

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:14.720
As for this Ma Wencai character,

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.079
why not let He Lianchen do it?

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:47.480
Come on, come on, come on.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.720
Alright, everyone,

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.920
let's rehearse one last time today.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.359
Perform well tomorrow.

00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:56.839
Why are you alone?

00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:58.000
Where's the leaf-blower?

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.160
Princess,

00:24:59.359 --> 00:25:00.440
he has a stomach ache.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:01.759
He'll be a bit late.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.759
Then I'll take his place.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.400
Let's begin officially.

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:07.759
You can blow leaves too?

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.559
Who said the music has to be leaf-blowing?

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.000
I can play the zither.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.400
That year, in a light rain of apricot blossoms,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.200
Zhu Yingtai, disguised as a man,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.000
encountered the scholar Liang Shanbo.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.519
They became fast friends at first sight.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.799
Hey, that maid, pay attention!

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:38.759
You've been rolling your eyes a bit too much lately.

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:44.759
Smoke effect,

00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:45.480
go!

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.559
I think Lord Meng and the Princess are a perfect match.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.599
But the Princess is already betrothed to Lord Yuwen.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.359
Looking at it this way,

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:07.279
isn't Lord Yuwen just like Ma Wencai?

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:08.839
Yes.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.359
The two studied together for three years,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.119
inseparable.

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:17.920
Background music, go!

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.279
Why have you all run over there?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.319
Don't you have any self-awareness?

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.640
Okay, the music is indeed a bit intense.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.839
But you need to have conviction!

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:19.400
Until I call cut,

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.240
you must keep acting.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.519
Let's go.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.759
I'll play the zither instead.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:34.920
Mm-hmm.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.400
A Lan.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.319
Can I change the maid I'm playing?

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.640
How do you want to change it?

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:43.680
The maid I play hates evil fiercely.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.160
She can't stand He Lian...

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.400
...and can't stand Ma Wencai forcing her mistress to marry.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.839
So she finds a chance to beat him up severely.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.359
Beats him until he's searching for his teeth.

00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:56.559
He wouldn't even recognize his own father.

00:27:57.599 --> 00:27:58.960
Then he kneels and begs for mercy.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.480
But how could this young lady forgive him?

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:03.599
Of course, she beats him so badly...

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:05.039
...he can't get out of bed for half a month.

00:28:05.319 --> 00:28:05.720
Stop.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.799
You're just a maid.

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:10.279
Aren't you adding too much extra drama?

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.319
A Lan.

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:13.839
Please agree to it.

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:15.119
Let me give it a try.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.799
I've been diligently practicing martial arts these days.

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:20.480
I just want a chance to fight He Lianchen.

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:22.640
Last time he said...

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.200
...if I want to defeat him...

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:26.240
...it's absolutely impossible in this lifetime.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.839
I can't swallow that insult.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.759
Miss Meng.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.279
You're no match for me.

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:34.759
We'll only know if we're matched by competing.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.960
This young lady wants to see...

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.480
...just how capable you really are.

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:41.079
A Lan.

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:42.759
Just let me have one fight.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.039
If I win...

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.640
...add the scene where the maid teaches Ma Wencai a lesson...

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.160
...into the play. How about it?

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.240
Alright.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.359
But stop when you've made your point.

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:10.000
Forget it, Miss Meng.

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.640
You're truly not my match.

00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:13.000
So much talk.

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:13.640
Come on.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.799
Why aren't you making a move?

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.119
Are you looking down on me?

00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:23.519
Since Miss Meng insists...

00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:26.079
...then I, He, will spar with you.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:27.759
However, when I strike...

00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:29.119
...I might not know my own strength.

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:29.799
Enough talk.

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:31.119
Show me your real skill.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.079
Miss Meng.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.200
Miss Meng.

00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:05.400
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:07.640
Don't you worry about whether I'm pushing myself.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.240
Come on.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.400
Are you hurt?

00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:23.240
This time, my skill was inferior.

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:25.480
Next time, you won't be so lucky.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.960
Since you lost...

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.640
...then the scene of the maid beating up Ma Wencai...

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:33.480
...should probably be dropped.

00:30:40.039 --> 00:30:40.559
Alright, alright.

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:41.279
Let's...

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:41.880
...take a break.

00:30:42.079 --> 00:30:43.319
We'll continue rehearsing later.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.480
Come here, come here, come here.

00:30:52.599 --> 00:30:54.880
Why was a scene suddenly added to the ending?

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.359
A scene of me marrying A Zi.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.039
And it's so... intimate.

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:59.799
What? You marrying my Royal Sister?

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:01.559
This is Liang Shanbo's dream.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.440
He dreams of marrying Zhu Yingtai.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:04.960
I'm saying...

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.200
...can't you forget your status?

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.240
Properly immerse yourself in the role.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.079
But this kissing... the kiss...

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.599
I've already discussed it with Royal Sister.

00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:15.319
We'll fake it when the time comes.

00:31:15.759 --> 00:31:16.759
What does "fake it" mean?

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:17.960
I've already explained it to you all.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.240
Why are you so hung up on this?

00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:24.319
Do you have a guilty conscience?

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.559
I do not.

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:28.119
Then why are you being awkward?

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.279
I...

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:41.880
This...

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:44.359
...is a list of officials secretly working for Prince Ning.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.759
Go and verify it.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.000
Fifth Princess.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.519
Has been rehearsing the play in the palace recently.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.160
Yes.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.839
The Fifth Princess even played the zither herself today.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.319
However, the music was simply...

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.839
...unbearable to listen to.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.799
She really is carefree.

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:24.680
Princess.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.880
You must be exhausted from these past days.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.200
You've all worked hard too.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.359
If you want to see me...

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.519
...use this firework as a signal.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.799
Have you heard anything recently...

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.559
...regarding court affairs?

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.440
Court affairs?

00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:56.720
What does Your Highness mean?

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.599
Didn't Father command...

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:03.839
...Yuwen Rui to investigate Prince Ning's remaining forces?

00:33:05.319 --> 00:33:06.400
This servant only heard...

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.680
...that His Majesty ordered Lord Yuwen...

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.279
...to fully investigate Prince Ning's actions over the years.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.720
As for other matters...

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.799
...I'm not clear.

00:33:17.119 --> 00:33:19.119
It's been several days...

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:20.960
...since the last Cuju match.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.759
Including today...

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:24.799
...it's been seven days.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.799
Perhaps he's already investigated and found out...

00:33:53.799 --> 00:33:54.799
...the mysterious person's identity.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.679
Come if you want, or don't.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.639
You've been waiting a long time.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.960
Who's waiting for you?

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.440
Stubborn.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.000
I resisted coming to the palace...

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.840
...just to see...

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.800
...when exactly you...

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.000
...would send me a message.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480
You're quite heartless.

00:35:34.159 --> 00:35:36.039
It took you a full seven days to think of seeing me.

00:35:36.679 --> 00:35:37.800
Who's thinking of you?

00:35:38.599 --> 00:35:39.719
I just wanted to ask...

00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:41.320
...about the mysterious person.

00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:43.760
Is that so?

00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:46.039
You call me here so late, not sleeping...

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:47.840
...just to ask me that?

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:50.280
Is that not allowed?

00:35:57.519 --> 00:35:58.119
No.
