WEBVTT

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.560
Elder Brother is getting married today.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.760
Why is it that across the Immortal and Demon Realms,

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.480
not a single person has come?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.640
Luo Sha?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.560
The frenzy affliction of both clans,

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.680
was it your doing?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.840
You recognized me.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.840
Luo Sha is my sister.

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.400
You impersonate her,

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.919
how could I not know?

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520
I was born from the resentment of immortals and demons.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.039
Your demonic energy

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.759
will only nourish me.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.240
Elder Brother...

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.319
Luo Sha!

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.039
I'm the one who dragged you down.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.080
If it weren't for me,

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.719
none of this would have happened.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.120
Your injuries are too severe.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.199
Don't speak.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.759
Your brother will definitely save you.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.240
Jin Li.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.840
That day in the cave,

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.479
the person you saw

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.199
was the Soul-Devouring Demon.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.639
In the Celestial Realm,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.319
Elder Brother never intended to harm you.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.400
If he hadn't met you,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.840
he wouldn't be so humane.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680
Without you,

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.879
he would never become the master of both realms.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.919
No.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.240
Luo Sha, what are you doing?

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.080
He possessed my body.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.319
I can still feel the Soul-Devouring Demon's spirit.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.800
Now,

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.039
this is the only way.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.319
Luo Sha!

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.639
Luo Sha!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.319
Elder Brother...

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.439
In this life,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.720
I have wronged you.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.199
We didn't get to drink yesterday's wine.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.639
Today's wedding toast,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.639
I'm afraid we won't get to drink that either.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.839
No, Luo Sha.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.519
No.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:38.160
It won't.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.160
No!

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.439
Luo Sha!

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:17.519
I am your elder brother.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.160
From now on, you don't need

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.560
to stand in front of me.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.120
We are all family.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.240
Why distinguish between you and me?

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:25.759
Besides,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.240
didn't you say

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.079
you would take me to see

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:30.519
the flower our Immortal mother spoke of,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.839
the Immortal Spirit Flower?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.759
I really wanted to see what the darn thing looks like.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.399
Since we're going to attack the Celestial Realm,

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:43.839
weapons are a must.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.120
Then I'll take this blade

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.399
and help you seize the rule of both realms.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:00.680
This cup of wine,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.839
your elder brother will drink it for you.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:12.439
Little sister.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.160
You gave your life

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:17.120
for just a promise.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.040
Was it worth it?

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.279
It was.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.519
Her only regret

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.160
was not apologizing to you.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.439
Luo Sha's nature was not evil.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.560
Since childhood,

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.839
she was taught the law of the jungle.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.319
A half-breed

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.680
who didn't fight

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.160
could not survive.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.480
In the end,

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.560
even she herself forgot

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:45.399
that when she attacked the Celestial Realm,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.120
she just wanted to see the Immortal Spirit Flower.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:51.279
If the two clans are at peace,

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:54.720
the flowers of the Immortal Clan will surely bloom across the Demon Realm.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.480
Luo Sha.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.079
What this one promised you,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.680
will definitely be fulfilled.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.000
From this day forth,

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.319
the Immortal and Demon Realms shall be connected.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.120
The Sun Divine Artifact shall be shared by both realms.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.879
Immortals and demons shall rule in peace together,

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.040
without infringing upon each other.

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:30.519
Wonderful!

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.399
Wonderful! No more war!

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.559
The Mozun attacked our Celestial Realm,

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.559
seized our divine artifact.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.320
Now he speaks of peaceful co-rule?

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.159
How can anyone be convinced?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.279
The Immortal and Demon Realms

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.639
have been in conflict for millennia.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.639
The Demon Realm

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.840
cannot live normally due to the miasma.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.080
Is the Celestial Realm peaceful every day,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.519
carefree and without worry?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.399
Don't you also constantly fear

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.240
the resurgence of war,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.440
to the point you cannot cultivate and ascend?

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.559
Moreover,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.440
the Demon Realm's Demon Life Fruit,

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:04.399
which can aid Celestial cultivation,

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:07.200
isn't that also a treasure you all covet?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.840
Peaceful coexistence

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.120
benefits the people of both realms.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.480
If the Immortal Lord does not desire peace,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.840
do you wish to continue fighting?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.639
What about the Sun Artifact

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.399
that Mozun took?

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:27.240
The Sun Artifact

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:29.279
has been returned to the Sunlit Pavilion.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.759
It is jointly guarded by both realms.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.360
If you Immortal Lords doubt this,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.559
you may return to the Celestial Realm to see.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.639
Go back.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.039
So, he is...

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.240
not watching us anymore?

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.080
As long as you Immortal Lords

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:45.480
do not target the Demon Clan,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.639
and allow free passage between realms,

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.000
from today onward,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.639
all guards will be withdrawn.

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:54.639
You may freely travel between both realms.

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:56.240
Not limited to trade.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:58.039
Not limited to marriage.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.679
For those not guilty of heinous crimes,

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.240
there are no travel restrictions.

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:03.279
The trade of Demon-Life Fruits

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.919
is also now

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.879
officially open to your Immortal Clan.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.080
Great! Jin Li!

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.799
This is wonderful!

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.360
Amazing!

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:16.360
Jin Li!

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:18.240
From today, we can visit the Demon Realm too!

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.960
And we can eat Demon-Life Fruits!

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.159
Yes. It's all over.

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:22.080
We are free.

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:24.480
So great.

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:27.200
It's wonderful. Yes.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.200
In the future,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.799
we must travel all across both realms.

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:30.639
Excellent!

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.039
Even better than before.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.559
Fantastic!

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.080
Wonderful!

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.440
The Immortals...

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:03.440
have all left.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.039
Mm-hmm.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:08.919
Good.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.240
It's fine that they're gone.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.039
This one is still reluctant

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:14.960
to part with the Demon Realm's beauty.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.679
I will not go to the Celestial Realm.

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:18.279
Tell the demon subjects below:

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.559
Those willing to go to the Immortal Realm

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.360
may proceed on their own.

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.360
Those willing to stay,

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:25.240
this one will treat them well.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.200
But most of the demon subjects

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.039
still share Mozun's sentiment.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.559
They wish to remain in the Demon Realm.

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:34.480
You didn't leave.

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:40.039
Ying Ge bought several cartloads of fruits.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.679
She's nagging for someone to haul them back.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.759
Now,

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:46.600
we need not worry about demons lacking flowers.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:49.279
This is all your doing.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.320
And yours.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.120
It was us together.

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:57.399
You...

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.639
when are you leaving?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.919
I've clarified that the attack on the Celestial Realm

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.440
was not your betrayal.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.120
The people of the Immortal Realm...

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:06.480
won't give you trouble, will they?

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:11.480
Though Ying Ge testified for me,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.639
some minor immortals may still target me

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:15.639
without knowing the full story.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.240
If anyone bullies you,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.320
activate this.

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:21.919
No matter when or where,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.279
I will definitely appear.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.240
Distant water can't quench a nearby fire.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.159
It would take you time to get here.

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:31.759
In the battle with the Soul-Devouring Demon,

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.080
if I had no merit, I at least suffered hardship.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.279
You're fobbing me off with this?

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:35.559
Then what do you want?

00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:37.039
This one will give you anything.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.279
The Demon Clan's rare fruits and treasures...

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:45.120
are not bad.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.799
Prepare them.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.480
The Immortal Clan's techniques and secret weapons...

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:54.679
are also not bad.

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:56.879
Prepare them.

00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:03.000
The rare treasures and beasts of all realms...

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.320
I want them all.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.360
Prepare them.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:06.879
What else do you want?

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:07.960
Write it all down for me.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.159
This one will prepare it immediately.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.919
So generous?

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:15.039
You'll give me all that?

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:16.240
Well, thanks then.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.240
I'm leaving.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.759
Well...

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.600
Don't you have a mouth?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.639
You won't even say you want me to stay?
