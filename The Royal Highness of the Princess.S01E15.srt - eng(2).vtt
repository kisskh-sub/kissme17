WEBVTT

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.040
Princess

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.439
Princess

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.159
Princess

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.719
How could I have such a dream?

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.960
Princess, what's wrong?

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.240
Your servant will help you get up.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.039
The Flower Festival Banquet is about to begin.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.439
Get ready, it's time to go.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.960
Royal Sister

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:49.879
Do you really intend

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.520
after winning those White Jade Mandarin Ducks today,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.960
to confess your feelings to Seventh Cousin?

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.319
As expected of my Royal Sister.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:01.360
I dare say

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.879
that in Seventh Cousin's heart,

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.120
you definitely have a place.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.960
Such great skill.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.639
Why hasn't Seventh Cousin arrived yet?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.599
Didn't he really want those White Jade Mandarin Ducks?

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.120
Princess

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.919
Princess

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.800
Young Master Xiu, he...

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.199
What is it?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.919
Young Master Xiu sent word

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.800
saying he has an upset stomach today.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.360
He can't perform in this play.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.680
He asked Young Master Meng to take his place.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.919
Do you know where he went?

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:53.479
I'll go check.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.759
Roy...

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.479
Now the Fourth Princess has left too.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.000
A Lan, what should we do now?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.639
Here's an idea.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.039
Shao Jue and I will first substitute for Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.520
for the opening narration.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.719
Commander He can read it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.120
We'll go over once we're ready.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.279
Judging by this play,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.399
A Lan and I will be buried together.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.519
If not for that scoundrel Ma Wencai,

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.519
Brother and A Lan would have eloped long ago.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.680
This is...

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.000
Royal Sister and Seventh Cousin had urgent business.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.160
Shao Jue and I are substituting for them.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.279
I can't talk anymore.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.279
We have to hurry over.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.959
You all go ahead.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.040
I'll be right there.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.040
Then be quick!

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.319
Playing the zither and dancing with swords together

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.519
is rather interesting.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:04.600
In the end,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.839
the two transformed into a pair of butterflies.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.439
That year, with apricot blossoms and light rain,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.079
Zhu Yingtai disguised herself as a man

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.600
and met the scholar Liang Shanbo.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.839
The two of them, at first sight...

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.240
Look.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.279
"The one I long for is across the water."

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.279
The two of them, at first sight...

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.959
As soon as they met,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.480
Liang Shanbo was poisoned and died.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.399
He kicked the bucket.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.480
I truly didn't expect it to be like this.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.639
How could Liang Shanbo die as soon as he appears?

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.240
Why change a perfectly good play

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.160
into something like this?

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:46.959
Just follow his instructions for now.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.839
Shanbo

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.360
Shanbo

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.480
Shanbo

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.600
After Liang Shanbo's death,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.959
Zhu Yingtai became a suspect.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.399
The Magistrate ordered her thrown into prison.

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.000
Let go of me!

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.560
The scholar Ma Wencai ran around everywhere,

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.519
trying to clear Zhu Yingtai's name.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.720
How dare you!

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.360
Ma Wencai and Zhu Yingtai hit it off immediately.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.279
They studied together,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.399
inseparable day after day.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.240
Yuwen Rui!

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.000
What are you doing?

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:54.839
I made a slight change.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.959
Don't worry.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.079
It will only be more perfect than before.

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:01.879
If we don't win the prize,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.040
I won't let you off the hook.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:04.600
Trust me.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.000
Seventh Cousin.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:22.439
A Zi.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.959
How did you know I was here?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.839
In the past, when you were unhappy,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.759
you would come here.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.120
I'm not unhappy.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.279
I just...

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.559
have an upset stomach.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.559
The things A Lan and I said,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.399
you heard them all,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.799
didn't you?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.240
If you heard,

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.200
with such a reaction,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.480
the answer is self-evident.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.759
However,

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.440
some words

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.559
I still must tell you myself.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.240
I, An Kezi,

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:11.200
truly like you.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:26.600
After three years as classmates,

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:28.440
after several misunderstandings were cleared,

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.120
after facing life and death together,

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:32.240
Ma Wencai finally realized

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.440
that Zhu Yingtai was a woman.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.519
So he went to propose marriage.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440
With a dowry stretching for miles,

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:38.919
a proper wedding was arranged.

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:41.799
On the wedding day,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.639
Ma Wencai personally helped Zhu Yingtai

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.120
with her makeup and attire.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.919
What are you thinking about?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.080
N-nothing.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.320
Hurry up.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.440
Aren't you done yet?

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.360
Just one last step.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.000
The lovers finally became a couple.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.039
Perfect harmony, everlasting love.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.320
It's just a play.

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:00.440
Why be so awkward?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.799
What kind of monstrous rewrite is this?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.600
Do you remember the scene in the play

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:04.840
with Liang Shanbo's dream?

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.320
Th-that was...

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:19.480
p-performed quite well.

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:31.480
This play is rather interesting.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.799
Looking at it this way,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.200
the Fifth Princess and Lord Yuwen

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.559
are truly a perfect match.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.279
I really envy the Fifth Princess.

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.759
She gets to marry Lord Yuwen in the future.

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:44.679
The Fifth Princess made many scenes before

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.120
trying to break off the engagement.

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:47.720
No matter how unwilling she is,

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:49.960
the Fifth Princess can only marry Lord Yuwen.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.120
Their betrothal was bestowed by the late Empress Dowager.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.039
Indeed.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480
Come, let's have a drink.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.759
Alright, I'll toast you.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.440
Ying Lu.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.159
I have a matter to discuss with His Majesty.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.720
You are an actor, after all.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.360
How did you get nervous acting out a kiss scene?

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:16.840
Yuwen Rui is good-looking,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.399
but aren't you too easily swayed by a pretty face?

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:20.080
A Lan.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.480
Wait for me.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.200
Yinglu.

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:25.519
You've all left, one by one.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.720
Leaving me all alone.

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:28.360
Where did your brother go?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.960
He went to see His Majesty.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.200
What does he want with my father?

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.360
Your Majesty.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.879
The Flower Festival Banquet shouldn't be over yet.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:42.240
Would you like to go take a look?

00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:47.200
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.240
What are you doing here?

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.200
This humble subject has been here,

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.879
waiting for Your Majesty for quite some time.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.039
You have business?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.519
This humble subject has an impertinent request.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.279
Speak.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.240
I humbly beseech Your Majesty

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:09.080
to cancel the Fifth Princess's engagement to the Grand Chancellor.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:10.080
Preposterous!

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.840
A Lan's engagement was settled long ago.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.919
How can it be canceled on a whim?

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.159
Marriage is a major affair,

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.720
concerning the Fifth Princess's entire life.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.200
I beg Your Majesty to think more of A Lan.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.960
We,

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.159
are naturally considering her.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.240
This humble subject has heard a plague has broken out in Jingzhou.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.279
Your Majesty is troubled,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.159
wondering whom to send to resolve the epidemic.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.519
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.399
This humble subject is willing to go to Jingzhou to resolve the plague.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:43.679
You?

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:49.480
Currently, within the court,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.000
there are few who can go to Jingzhou

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.159
to ease Your Majesty's worries.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.159
But how can We trust you?

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.639
This matter concerns the lives of the people.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.919
This humble subject would never dare speak recklessly.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.240
Does Your Majesty recall

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.920
the snow disaster in the south the year before last?

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.279
Naturally, I remember.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.519
That year, thanks to your father's proposal

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.200
to grant the wealthy who aided the court's relief efforts

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.720
the qualification of Imperial College students,

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:20.640
it prompted the noble families to donate money and grain,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.440
resolving the urgent crisis.

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:25.920
That plan was proposed by this humble subject.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.799
If I cannot contain the Jingzhou epidemic,

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:33.359
I am willing to atone with my death.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.640
If I successfully control the Jingzhou epidemic,

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:48.799
I beg Your Majesty to grant my request.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.759
You want Us

00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:56.440
to betroth A Lan to you?

00:17:57.359 --> 00:17:58.000
No.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.400
Your Majesty need only grant the Fifth Princess freedom in marriage.

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:10.359
We agree.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.319
However,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720
there is one condition.

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:15.240
After you return from Jingzhou,

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.759
you must enter the court as an official.

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.119
Why hasn't brother returned yet?

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.480
I heard from Little Li Zi

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.079
that Father greatly admires Shaojue.

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:29.799
Perhaps the two of them are discussing

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:30.799
the matter of entering the court as an official.

00:18:31.119 --> 00:18:33.079
Even if His Majesty kills him, it would be useless.

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:34.799
When Mother passed away,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920
brother swore an oath

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.519
that he would never become a court official in this life.

00:18:37.839 --> 00:18:38.559
Why?

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:40.799
When Mother was alive,

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.640
Father was always busy with official duties

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.119
and neglected to care for Mother.

00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:46.039
Later, Mother fell ill,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.400
and Father was away handling official business, too busy to return home.

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:50.920
Even when Mother passed away from illness,

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:53.400
Father couldn't return to see her one last time.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:55.559
From that time on, brother

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.400
has loathed the idea of being an official.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:03.480
He should have entered the court five years ago.

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:04.400
Well?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.000
Good.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.359
It's settled then.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.960
We will issue an edict ordering the Jingzhou Magistrate

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.039
to follow your command.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.720
This...

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:34.839
If you have something to say, speak plainly.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.880
Your Majesty,

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:39.680
the Fifth Princess previously

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.359
tried every method to break off the engagement.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.079
You never agreed.

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:47.400
So why have you agreed to Young Master Meng's request now?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.319
We did not cancel her engagement

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.559
because Minister Yuwen is truly a good match.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.400
We did not want her to miss out.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.880
But now it seems

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:04.079
this Meng Shaojue is utterly sincere towards A Lan.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.680
If in the future A Lan can marry him,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
it might not be such a bad thing.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.440
Has Father truly decided to send Young Master Meng

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.640
to Jingzhou to handle the plague situation?

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.400
Five years ago, at the palace examination,

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:24.039
I knew he was no ordinary man.

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:25.319
Since he says

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:27.720
he is confident he can control the plague in Jingzhou,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.039
I will trust him.

00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:32.519
Young Master Meng has always disliked court politics.

00:20:32.839 --> 00:20:34.359
Why would he suddenly take on this matter?

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:38.759
People change.

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:40.279
Enough about him.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.799
I summoned you here

00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:44.680
because we have a lead on Shadow Gate disciples.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:46.880
After Yunze's destruction,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.880
the Shadow Gate began to decline.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.559
Now, they are nearly extinct.

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:52.799
How did Father discover their trail?

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:54.599
All these years,

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.880
I have secretly ordered people to search

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.240
for traces of Shadow Gate disciples.

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:02.119
Recently, a spy reported a clue.

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:05.359
Someone used Ice-Soul Silver Thread in Tianyin City.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:07.039
Ice-Soul Silver Thread...

00:21:07.759 --> 00:21:08.920
The signature weapon of

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.680
Yun Shang, the Shadow Gate's top disciple.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.759
Yun Shang of the Shadow Gate is likely in Tianyin City.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.480
Depart as soon as possible

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.119
to find his trail.

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:21.160
You must uncover the secret of the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:22.680
Your son obeys. Your servant obeys.

00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:24.400
This matter is of great importance.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.400
Do not make it public.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:26.920
You shall travel south

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:29.519
under the pretext of inspecting the provinces.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.279
Brother...

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:38.839
Perhaps you shouldn't go to Jingzhou.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.519
Don't worry.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.599
I'll be fine.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.160
A Lan is worried about me.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.240
The plague is no joke.

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:53.039
What should I do?

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:55.000
I already miss him, and he hasn't even left.

00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:56.680
Once I reach Jingzhou,

00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:57.880
I'll write to you.

00:21:58.799 --> 00:21:59.519
Brother Meng,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.519
if you write to Luo Jing,

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:03.400
A Lan likely won't receive it.

00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:06.279
A Lan is coming south with us.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.680
Why the rush to go south?

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.319
Prince Ning remains unconscious.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.279
So the mysterious figure behind him

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:26.920
is the real villain, right?

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:29.480
Stop trying to pry information from me.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.000
I just came to tell you

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.400
you must also go with them

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.759
to Tianyin City.

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.680
The next mission is in Tianyin City.

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:43.119
I have some official business to attend to.

00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:45.880
You and...

00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:50.559
I'm uneasy about you going south.

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.359
Otherwise, wait for me to return, and I'll accompany you.

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:53.920
What's there to be uneasy about?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.160
I'll return once my business is done.

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:56.240
I must go.

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:58.599
At a time like this,

00:22:58.599 --> 00:23:00.079
you still have the leisure to worry about others?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.160
Oh, right.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.240
I prepared something for you.

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.759
These gloves and this mask

00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:10.839
were specially made for you.

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.960
Remember to wear them once you're in Jingzhou,

00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:14.599
especially when contacting patients.

00:23:14.599 --> 00:23:15.240
Also,

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:16.920
this letter contains instructions.

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.079
After arriving in Jingzhou,

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:19.519
assign some personnel specifically

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:20.400
to have them make more

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.519
and distribute them to the local people.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.920
These items are quite novel.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.400
Have you prepared them for anyone else?

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:34.000
I have never received

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.279
such a special gift.

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:36.799
If not...

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.599
A Lan, help me put them on.

00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:41.400
You don't even know how?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.519
It's very simple.

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:43.279
Here.

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:48.640
It's getting late.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.240
Young Master Meng, time to set off.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.359
Big brother!

00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:55.440
What do you mean 'set off'?

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.200
That sounds terrible!

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.079
Once Young Master Meng reaches Jingzhou,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.440
give this edict to the Jingzhou Magistrate.

00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:16.480
Brother Meng,

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:17.880
take care on your journey.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:18.759
Take care.

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:19.480
Young Master Meng...

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:25.359
When I return to the capital,

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:26.960
I have something to tell you.

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:33.400
What can't you say now?

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.079
I'm off.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.920
Brother, take care.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.160
Take care.

00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:56.359
How long are you going to keep watching?

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.039
My brother is going to Jingzhou,

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.079
and you're heading south too.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.240
What's the point of staying in Luo Jing?

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:06.200
Alright.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200
I'll be back soon.

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:07.960
Wait for me to return,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.759
I'll bring you a gift.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.680
Then I'm leaving.

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:14.160
Commander He.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:14.960
Let's go.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.759
Commander He, Miss Meng.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:17.799
Farewell.

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:23.240
Seventh Cousin, you're so pampered.

00:25:23.599 --> 00:25:25.039
What makes you want to go south?

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.759
Naturally, because the scenery south of the river is beautiful.

00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:39.759
Just for the scenery?

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:40.839
Of course.

00:25:41.319 --> 00:25:42.759
What else could it be?

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.079
I was just asking casually.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.519
Why are you so nervous?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.799
I...

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.240
Miss Meng.

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:04.119
Why are you calling me?

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.720
I am not familiar with you.

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:08.160
Regarding our last match,

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:10.039
I, He, was too heavy-handed.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.279
I've been wanting to find a chance to apologize.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.559
Unnecessary.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.599
Last time, I lost because my skills were inferior.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.440
But don't get too cocky.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.839
One day,

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:24.359
I will definitely beat you until you're picking your teeth off the ground.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.119
With Miss Meng's foundation,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.400
if you wish to defeat me,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.359
it is absolutely impossible in this lifetime.

00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:31.519
You, surnamed He!

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:32.920
Don't you look down on people!

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.240
Is what I, He, said incorrect?

00:26:35.319 --> 00:26:35.759
You!

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.240
Just you wait!

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:50.279
I... I have something to give you.

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.200
This is something I, He,

00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:59.119
wrote based on your martial arts level.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920
After our last match,

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.720
I, He, analyzed your internal energy

00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:04.759
I've gained some understanding of your physical skills and techniques.

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:09.240
You learned all that just from sparring with me?

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.559
After our last match,

00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:14.079
I, He, wrote these two manuals.

00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:15.240
Suitable for you, Miss Meng, to practice.

00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:17.160
It's just that usually,

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:18.960
I'm used to sparring with palace guards,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.160
so I don't know my own strength.

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:21.480
I actually ended up injuring you, Miss Meng.

00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:24.400
Once you finish practicing these two manuals,

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:25.960
I'll then, based on your progress,

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.559
continue writing more.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.640
Who said I was going to practice?

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:38.640
Well, if you don't want to practice,

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.440
it's fine to just flip through them for fun in your spare time.

00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:03.279
Shao Jue has never been interested in official matters.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.160
Why would he suddenly request an imperial decree to go to Jingzhou?

00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:06.480
Is there some inside story?

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.319
Father didn't tell you?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.319
The more I think about it, the stranger it seems.

00:28:19.079 --> 00:28:19.640
Tell me,

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.319
you talk so much.

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.480
Aren't you thirsty?

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.519
Seventh Cousin these past two days

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.200
seems to be avoiding me everywhere.

00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:32.359
How could that be?

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.599
Was it something I said that day

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:36.799
that troubled you?

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.599
How could it?

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240
What if you and I swap with Royal Sister

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.559
and Seventh Cousin?

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.440
I'll go ride a horse,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.359
and you go drive the carriage.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.400
Leave the carriage to them for their alone time.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.039
How about it?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.160
Royal Sister,

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.519
I feel like riding a horse.

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:04.640
Let's swap, you and I.

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:11.960
Zi Xiu,

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.279
you go inside.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.160
I'll drive.

00:29:18.039 --> 00:29:18.960
No need, Elder Brother.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.920
I really enjoy driving.

00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:29.079
You're just asking for trouble.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.000
A Lan and I will go scout the road ahead.

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.000
What are you doing?

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.000
Weren't you the one who said to let them

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.799
have their alone time?

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:45.400
I...

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:46.960
Hold on tight.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.440
Get in the carriage.

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:10.799
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.720
N-nothing.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.359
What exactly did Father send you south for?

00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:24.519
What is the real purpose?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.920
His Majesty ordered me

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.680
and the Fourth Princess to find the whereabouts

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.759
of Shadow Gate's top disciple, Yun Shang.

00:30:31.319 --> 00:30:32.240
Shadow Gate?

00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:35.119
I heard from Little Li Zi

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.160
that Shadow Gate seems to know

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.559
the secrets within the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.039
His Majesty sent people to search for years before learning

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.960
that Shadow Gate's Master Yun Shang

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.599
is most likely hiding in Tianyin City.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.319
What kind of person

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.759
is this Master Yun Shang?

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.400
Very little is known.

00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:55.519
We only know his personal weapon is Ice-Soul Silver Thread.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.240
If we go south,

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:00.400
what about the mysterious figure behind Prince Ning?

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:02.160
I've already had He Lianchen spread the word

00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:04.599
that Shadow Gate's Yun Shang is in Tianyin City.

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:10.400
You want to lure the mysterious figure to Tianyin City.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.960
If he wants to learn the map's secrets,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.000
he'll have to make a move.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.160
Once he acts, he'll show his flaws.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.279
I knew it!

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.839
How come you agreed to go south so suddenly?

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.960
You were already prepared.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.640
Hyah!

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:36.319
Seventh Cousin,

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:38.839
I have something to say to you.

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:46.200
When I said I liked you that day,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.359
I meant it sincerely.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.119
If I, An Kezi, like someone,

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:53.359
I'll let him know.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.519
If he likes me too,

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.519
then it's heaven's blessing.

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:00.000
If I'm not in his heart,

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.839
I will accept it calmly.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.839
Seeing you so uncomfortable now,

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.599
just pretend my previous words

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.160
were never spoken.

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:03.920
Luo Jing is so boring!

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:05.279
Brother and A Lan are both gone.

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:12.440
What are you doing here?

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:17.359
I have some business with Grand Preceptor Meng.

00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:20.200
Miss Meng,

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.559
how are those martial arts manuals?

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.279
I just glanced at them casually.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.279
They're... barely acceptable, I suppose.

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:34.400
Stop!

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:37.160
That movement is wrong.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.640
Your arms need to be relaxed.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.079
Your footwork must be steady.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.079
That's right, like this.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.400
Aren't you going to let me go?

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.480
When will you deliver the remaining volumes?

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.880
Didn't you say you'd keep writing?

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.480
What,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
only these two?

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.480
Miss Meng is referring to the martial arts manuals?

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.159
What else?

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.119
Darn it, you're so dense.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.480
The third and fourth volumes are almost finished.

00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:20.199
I'll bring them to you in a couple of days.

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:21.280
Fine.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.760
It just so happens I've been very idle lately.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.960
Although these manuals aren't written very well,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.599
but...

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.519
barely,

00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:31.800
they can still pass the time.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.519
Innkeeper!

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.599
Honored guests, please, have a seat!

00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:07.920
Waiter, bring tea!

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.440
Right away!

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:10.800
Innkeeper,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.760
once we pass through the woods ahead,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.239
will we reach Tianyin City?

00:36:16.199 --> 00:36:16.719
Well...

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.599
Wh-what's wrong?

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.679
You all...

00:36:28.159 --> 00:36:29.599
want to go to Tianyin City?

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.119
Yes.

00:36:33.079 --> 00:36:34.960
If you're going to Tianyin City, that's easy.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.719
Besides the woods ahead,

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:38.199
there's another small path

00:36:38.199 --> 00:36:39.199
that leads into the city.

00:36:40.159 --> 00:36:40.719
Oh, right.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.000
Second Master Luo is heading back to the city.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.360
You guests can follow him.

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:47.280
Second Master.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.719
These guests also want to enter the city.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.559
Second Master.

00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:53.239
Second Master.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.559
Second Master, what are you thinking about?

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.360
Second Master, do us a favor.

00:36:59.639 --> 00:37:01.800
Take these guests into the city by the detour.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:03.960
Thank you.

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:06.239
Innkeeper.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.480
What's strange about those woods?

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.119
I see you're all from out of town.

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:15.599
So I'll say a bit more.

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:19.280
That forest ahead...

00:37:19.559 --> 00:37:20.280
Now...

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:22.639
has become a taboo for Tianyin City.

00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:24.920
You must not venture into it.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:28.920
Second Master.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.440
Then I'll get you some more food.
