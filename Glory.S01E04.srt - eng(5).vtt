[Episode 4]

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.520
Wen Can acted flirtatious

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.050
and reckless in front of me.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.539
Did you teach him that?

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.350
What?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.039
Wen Can has been pampered since childhood.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.100
He's simple-minded and easy to fool.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.920
You'd better hope I don't find out

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.680
that someone is using him

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.140
for underhanded schemes.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.940
Otherwise,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.200
I won't let them get away with it.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.970
Miss Rong,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.260
did you know me before?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.980
What are you trying to say?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.640
Miss Rong, if you didn't know me,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.240
why did you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.630
judge me with such malice?

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.120
You...

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.120
How dare you!

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.500
What kind of person

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.590
do you think you are?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.120
I don't know.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.550
I don't remember my past.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.950
I don't remember who I am either.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.750
Miss Rong,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.350
if you really don't trust me,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.800
why not transfer me from Mr. Wen's side

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.660
to Qilan Garden

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.730
so that you can keep an eye on me?

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.560
Miss Rong.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.160
You may go now.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.920
Don't you like this whip?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.040
I said

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.730
I wouldn't accept gifts this time.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.750
This whip

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.380
is very handy for hitting people.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.160
Mr. He.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.100
Our Rong family has our own rules.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.090
You cutting out his tongue

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.310
was going too far.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.870
Miss Rong.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.130
That idiot tea merchant

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.680
was planning revenge
against you last night.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.030
You ought to thank me.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.300
Mind your own business.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.210
Step aside!

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.700
You don't remember anything at all?

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.280
What?

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.030
Miss Rong,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.040
you're so cold-hearted.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.720
Why didn't I get a return gift?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.720
Shanbao clearly said

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.920
everyone would get a return gift!

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.040
Mr. Wen, Miss Rong said
you didn't send anything,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.070
so there was no need for a return gift.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.320
Who said I didn't send a gift?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.050
I clearly...

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.870
I...

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.390
You may go now.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.560
You go stand guard outside Qilan Garden

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.390
and find out who Shanbao

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.680
is having dinner with tonight.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.540
Unless it's me,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.390
don't let anyone in.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.720
Me?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.190
Stop others?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.480
Shanbao said you're very capable.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.240
You can definitely do it.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.830
Hurry up!

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.480
Hurry up!

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.630
Go now!

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.830
Miss Rong,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.480
Steward Cheng came to ask

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.090
who should be invited to join for dinner.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.420
Bai Yingsheng.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.870
Yes.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.050
Why are you here?

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.360
Mr. Wen sent me here.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.720
Why did he send you here?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.830
Mr. Wen

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.690
asked me to stand guard here

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.190
to chase away other young masters

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.320
who come for dinner.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.010
You can go back now.

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.600
Miss Rong, you told me to go back,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.720
but Mr. Wen told me not to.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.190
This isn't the first time

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.920
I've been caught in the middle.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.630
Miss Rong, please tell me exactly

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.360
whose orders

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.280
I should follow from now on.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680
Follow my orders.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.600
Okay.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.580
Miss Rong, if you don't like it,

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.120
you don't actually have to choose anyone.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.970
Sorry that I spoke out of turn.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.850
You didn't just speak out of turn.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.390
You eavesdropped
on your master's conversation.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.160
I dare not.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.950
I only overheard a little bit

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.680
by accident.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.000
I just...

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800
I just feel sorry for you, Miss Rong.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.070
Mr. Bai,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.630
my young lady invites you to dinner.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.560
Very well. I'll be right there.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.920
I thought the dinner

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.040
was supposed to be held at Qilan Garden.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.720
Mr. Bai,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.870
are you that eager

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.600
to visit Shanbao's courtyard?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.730
Greetings, Fourth Young Lady.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.930
Please sit down. The food is getting cold.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.560
Was it the Fourth Young Lady

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.290
who asked you to invite me here?

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.830
What?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.630
Do you really think

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.560
it was Shanbao who invited you?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.270
I kindly invited you to dinner.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.680
Why the long face?

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.070
Do you think

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.730
I'm inferior to Rong Shanbao?

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.440
I dare not.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.630
Fourth Young Lady, you're so stunning

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.150
that no one dares to look directly at you.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.000
But I came here specifically

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.909
to compete for the position
as Miss Rong Shanbao's husband.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.120
So I dare not be wavering

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.980
in my devotion.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.440
I have let down your kind intentions,
Fourth Young Lady.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.500
Please forgive me.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.230
I'm sorry.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.120
Did you hear that just now?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.480
I originally wanted you to see

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.960
that idiot make a fool of himself.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.720
But in the end,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.320
I was the only one who got worked up!

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.840
Yunyin, don't be angry.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.320
There's plenty of time ahead,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.780
so there's no need to rush.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.600
Whoever

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.200
has crossed me

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.780
will pay for it!

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.040
Miss Rong,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.920
I got there a little too late.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.280
The Fourth Young Lady

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.350
sent for him first.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.320
I wasn't sure what to do,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.320
so I came back to ask for your orders.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.200
Should we

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.600
have him brought back?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.200
No need.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.300
Let her have her way.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.150
Yes, Miss Rong.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.560
Miss Rong,
shall we have the meal served now?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.120
Is he still there?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.620
He's still kneeling outside.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.180
Tell him to come in.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.910
Greetings, Miss Rong.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.270
Come in.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.890
Have you learned your lesson?

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.370
From now on,
I will be prudent in word and deed

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.240
and won't speak out of turn again.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.240
Do you resent me for punishing you?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.440
As I have said before,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.080
my life and death

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.520
are yours to command.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.360
So I am willing

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.560
to accept this punishment.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.110
Very good.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.630
Come and serve me.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.460
Steward Cheng,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.030
what kind of treasures could possibly

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.290
win Miss Rong's favor?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.530
Sorry that I spoke out of turn.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.360
Miss Rong.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.840
-Miss Rong.
-Miss Rong.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.540
Miss Rong.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.330
Where is your Chinese New Year pouch?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.590
It's been so busy in the household lately.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.190
I forgot to go and collect it.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.220
Steward Cheng.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.680
What is it?

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.120
Lady Rong has sent a message.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.390
Tomorrow at 5 AM,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.140
you need to go to the main gate
to welcome Mr. Yan.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.610
Got it.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.270
Yes.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.790
Mr. Yan, you've finally arrived.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.080
Lady Rong has been eagerly awaiting you.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.670
She has been talking about you for days.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.320
Earlier,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.120
she even wanted Miss Rong
to welcome you in person.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.750
[Yan Bailou]

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.270
We ran into a landslide
on the mountain road,

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.510
which delayed our journey
for several days.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.320
I'm truly sorry
for having made Lady Rong worried.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.650
I hope this hasn't disrupted any affairs
in your household.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.150
Mr. Yan, don't worry.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.120
Other young masters
have only been here for 5 days.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.810
Please come with me into the mansion.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:34.860
[Rong Mansion]

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.030
This is...

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.880
It's from the Fourth Young Lady.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.790
Please thank the Fourth Young Lady for me.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.050
I'll take my leave now.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.190
This is also from the Fourth Young Lady?

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.740
Mr. Bai,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.450
Xiuqiong from Qilan Garden

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.010
personally sent this over.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.910
Miss Rong sent me a martial outfit.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.770
Could it be that the next contest is...

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.360
Mr. Yang, what are you doing?

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.960
Miss Rong, yesterday

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.600
you didn't choose anyone to dine with you.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.150
I suppose you, having seen a lot,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.960
wouldn't settle for those trivial things.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.910
I just want to ask one last question.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.360
If I win tomorrow,

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.510
will you choose me?

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.530
We'll talk about it when you win.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.320
I will win!

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.910
Because no one

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.440
deserves you more than I do!

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.880
Bao,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.270
you must remember

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.040
that you share

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.550
the same ancestral roots
in the Rong family.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.590
A good marriage

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.740
can help the Rong family flourish

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.040
and prosper forever.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.770
But you're not the only granddaughter
in our family.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.710
If you don't care about this,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.850
there will always be someone who does.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.240
Don't make me worry about you.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.410
What's the fuss about?

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.550
It's just a man.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.790
Just pick one who's easy on the eye

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.730
and get to know him gradually.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.140
Time will tell

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.100
whether he's truly to your liking.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.350
There are so many young masters today.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.550
Which one do you like?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.410
I'll tell Grandmother for you.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.550
The Rong ancestors

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.510
established the tea trade
against insurmountable odds

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.640
They traversed treacherous waters,
scaled precipitous peaks,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.310
crossed barren deserts
and fought fierce bandits.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.830
A single misstep
would have meant utter destruction.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.030
Without any courage,

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.960
how could one be worthy of becoming
the Rong family's son-in-law?

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.270
Whoever is the first
to climb to the hanging bridge

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.330
and seize the prize

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.080
will be the winner in the martial contest.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.830
Those who fall off the bridge
will be eliminated on the spot.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.690
Young Masters,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.700
please be careful.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.110
The bridge pier is so narrow.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.000
It can't accommodate all of us.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.500
I suppose many will be forced to withdraw

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.410
before even reaching the top.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.560
Even if one climbs to the top,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.210
there's only one prize.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.200
I will definitely be the winner.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.980
Mr. Wen, I don't want to be the winner.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.580
I just want to stay safe.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.200
Please show some mercy to me.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:24.790
Don't worry.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.280
The martial contest begins!

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.400
Why haven't they started yet?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.920
-What's going on?
-Exactly.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.320
Planning before acting.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.340
You coward!

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.140
The faster they climb,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.800
the more quickly they'll die.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.860
This is the allure of the Rong family.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.990
Look how fiercely they're competing.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.510
Sometimes I truly resent my mother

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.720
for insisting on marrying
into another family.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.830
She never stopped to think

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.210
that a husband's heart might stray,

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.540
and an in-law's face might turn cold.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.920
Once she left the Rong family,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.550
she became

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.920
just another bargaining chip
weighed by others.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.720
And because of her choice,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.750
now I am an outsider too.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.350
After all, my surname is different
from yours.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.360
We share the same grandmother.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.310
Whatever your surname is,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.570
you're still my cousin.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.030
Take my advice.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.510
If you don’t want to go through
with the wedding rituals,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.840
just take someone in as a companion first.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.590
What matters is the Tea Bone.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.450
Don't let others get ahead of you.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.550
Look there.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:27.690
Yunxi,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.610
who do you think will be the winner?

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.110
The final winner

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.910
will become Shanbao's husband.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.920
Grandmother truly

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.440
has a unique way of choosing people.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.310
Yang!

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.570
You're despicable!

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.830
Great!

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.960
Mr. Yang is truly brave and valiant.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.630
I see no need to continue this contest.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.130
Shanbao, if you're to choose a husband,

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.510
who else could it be but him?

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.550
Mr. Yang has such a commanding presence

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.380
and exceptional courage.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.790
He is truly worthy of you.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.680
Shanbao, he's not worthy.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.340
No rush.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.040
Shanbao, I made it to the top.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.710
Wen Can seems a bit off.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:36.920
You!

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.630
Here you are.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.000
Come on, have some water.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.590
Mr. Wen.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:46.870
Thank you.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.350
The first half ends here.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.830
You!

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.040
Stop right there, all of you!

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.720
Our Rong family made it clear
from the beginning

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.450
that this contest is only
for testing martial skills,

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.110
not for fighting to the death.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.110
Young Masters, you must know when to stop.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.570
Whoever disobeys my order

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.450
shall also step down and concede defeat.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.590
What's the fun in fighting bare-handed?

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.590
Miss Rong has said

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.350
that those who made it to the bridge pier

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.960
may all enter the second half.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.740
Each of you can select a weapon
of your choice

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.670
to make the contest more exciting.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.440
Among all the food and drink
Mr. Wen consumed today,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.840
only the tea was taken
outside the mansion.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:57.240
Mr. Wen,

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.390
let me help you get some rest.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.810
I don't want to rest.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.800
Despicable.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.120
Miss Rong.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.790
Mr. Wen's tea

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.120
has been tampered with.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.030
No need to help me up.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.290
I can still keep fighting in the contest.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:32.960
I have a plan.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.480
Mr. Wen,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.550
Miss Rong noticed you're unwell.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.830
She told me to take you
to get your medicine first.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.760
Then you can continue the contest.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.690
Come with me.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.770
The useless one gets all the sympathy.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.050
They even suspended the contest for him.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.660
That Wen guy

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.200
is truly annoying.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.980
We'll see if he even lives long enough

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.290
to make it to the end.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.590
Mr. Wen.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.750
Where are we going to get the medicine?

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.240
Mr. Wen, let me take a look.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.660
You've been drugged,
so you are weak and exhausted.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.820
Miss Rong asked me to persuade you

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.150
not to compete anymore.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.280
It's none of your business.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.370
You must go, even if it costs your life?

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.680
Yes, I must go.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.940
Miss Rong?

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:43.570
I'm sorry.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.770
Mr. Wen, you're so delicate.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.750
After a little head injury,

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.270
you're armored

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.480
from head to toe.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.320
If you're that scared,

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:06.960
why not go back home

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.020
and never come out?

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.680
I'll knock that shell right off you!

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.470
If he's so scared,

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.570
he should just withdraw from the contest.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.090
Exactly. What a disgrace.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.220
Only these two are left.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.030
Take it.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.400
So she recognized me.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.270
What's all this?

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.040
How nauseating.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.330
If she just favors her cousin,

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.240
what's the point of us competing at all?

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.030
Isn't this just making a fool of us?

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.830
Miss Rong, you're showing such favoritism,

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.640
treating your cousin better than others.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.160
It'll be hard to convince everyone.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:57.690
Exactly!

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.640
Miss Rong, you're unfair.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.360
Unfair! We won't accept it!

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.920
We fight with all our might,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.240
while your Rong family
is making a fool of us.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.110
-Exactly! It's unfair!
-Exactly!

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.840
Someone tampered with his tea.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.310
The truth will be revealed
upon examination.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.960
Now,

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.420
does anyone still say I'm unfair?

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.440
Let's start now.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.490
Don't waste any more time.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.960
The contest continues.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.470
Aren't you going?

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.790
I wouldn't dare go first.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.110
After you.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.510
Don't let go!

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.560
Mr. Bai. Mr. Bai.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.440
He just passed out like that?

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.390
My legs...

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.420
Yang Dingchen!

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.090
Good! Well done!

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.030
Shanbao, look!

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.800
If you all help me get the prize,

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.400
our He family will reward you handsomely.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.890
Don't let him reap the benefits
from our rivalry.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.330
Who actually won, then?

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160
Well,

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.880
who should be the winner?

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.590
Miss Rong.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:44.110
Yes.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:48.070
The prize has been claimed.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.400
The martial contest ends here.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.510
Young Masters, please await

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.240
the next round of competition.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:53.960
You may go back to rest for now.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.310
[Xinfang Pavilion]

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.040
Come in.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.679
Miss Rong ordered me to bring

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.449
Mr. Zhao here today
for a follow-up examination.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.170
Please send my thanks to Miss Rong.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.050
I'm fine.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.630
Miss Rong has said

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.440
that his old injuries
are not yet resolved,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.909
and today he has got new wounds.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:45.880
Mr. Zhao, please

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.290
conduct a thorough examination today.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.440
If you need any medicinal herbs,

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.370
just let me know.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:50.190
Yes.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.679
I dare not disobey Miss Rong's orders.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.310
Greetings, Mr. Wen.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.510
Please wait a moment.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.070
Take my protective armor

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.380
and put it away carefully.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.410
Place it right in the middle

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.470
of that cabinet and lock it securely.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.030
Yes.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.630
Shanbao was worried that Yang Dingchen

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.320
would hold a grudge and get back at me.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.920
She personally sent this armor
to keep me safe.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.460
Miss Rong was here?

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.020
She left only a moment ago.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.350
Shanbao is being overly cautious.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.130
This is the Rong Mansion, after all.

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.320
I doubt Yang Dingchen

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.110
has the gall to pick a fight here.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.230
If he killed me,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.170
he'd be expelled
from the Rong Mansion for good.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.190
It's securely locked?

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.000
You may go now.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.760
Yes.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.110
No wonder someone is trying

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.630
to get rid of you at every turn.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.360
It must be because Miss Rong

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.080
shows you extraordinary kindness,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.640
far beyond what she extends to others.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.110
We grew up together.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.930
Naturally, our bond
is unlike anyone else's.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.400
Miss Rong,

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.760
you're showing too much favoritism.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.820
I invited you here today
to thank you.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.840
Shanbao told me what happened.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.230
I was rude to you at the contest arena.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.630
I hope you can forgive me.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.590
You're too kind, Young Master.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.760
I know my place.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.010
I don't deserve such thanks.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.130
I know Shanbao cares for me deeply.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.810
She seems cold-faced,

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.360
but she's soft-hearted.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.730
It's my own fault
for being incompetent in martial arts

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.390
and making her worry about me.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.550
Since Shanbao has put her trust in you,

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.590
then I will trust you too.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.140
I hope you can help me.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.760
I will surely repay your kindness
in the future.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.910
I will spare no effort

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.640
to live up to Miss Rong's trust.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.480
We all

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.290
fought tooth and nail to get here.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:43.750
What makes him so special?

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.810
Let's go check it out.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.670
Everyone, please calm down

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.670
and hear me out.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.550
-We won't listen!
-We won't listen!

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.150
What's the point of listening?

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.510
We all

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.710
fought tooth and nail to get here.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.190
This is unfair.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.480
Exactly!

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.760
What has he done to deserve it?

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.510
How is that even fair?

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.590
Since he got here,

00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.840
he has never shown his face.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.000
If he's not guilty,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.440
why is he hiding?

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.510
Ask him to come out!

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.030
Let him confront us face to face!

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.090
What dirty tricks is he up to in there?

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:06.900
Mr. Bai,

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.810
what's happening here?

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.540
It's all about Mr. Yan.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.110
He didn't take part
in the martial contest,

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.030
and everyone is seething with resentment.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.800
It's completely unfair!

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.300
Ask him to come out!

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.570
We barely see him around,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.580
yet the Rong family treats him
as an honored guest.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.950
It's truly puzzling.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.890
Yan? His surname is Yan?

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.740
Why does

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.590
this surname sound so familiar?

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.920
We all proved our worth
with our abilities, right?

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.280
Exactly!

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.030
He didn't even take part
in the martial contest.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.960
There's such a commotion outside,

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.390
yet the man inside remains undisturbed.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.200
How extraordinary.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.840
How is that even fair?

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.360
We'll wait right here.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:42.710
Shut up!

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.040
Let's see if he dares...

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.840
You useless cowards.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.580
Why not just go in and see for yourselves?

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:50.900
You!

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.810
Follow him.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.420
Mr. Yang.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.320
Mr. Yang.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.630
Everyone,

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.100
my young master has gone to Chongxi Hall.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.330
When he returns,

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.510
I will inform him.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.380
Chongxi Hall? Lady Rong?

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:14.840
Just who exactly

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.000
is this Mr. Yan?

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.760
Since Master Chanhui

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.200
created the 18 Dragon Movements,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.000
for a hundred years,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.710
they have only been performed

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.670
at the Tea Ceremony
at Ganlu Temple on Mount Meng.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.230
I never thought that today

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.960
I would witness it personally.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.880
This is all thanks to you.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.170
Lady Rong, you flatter me.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.800
Since childhood, I've made a vow

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.090
to serve Tea Master Wu on Mount Meng

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.130
and follow his path of helping people,

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.740
clearing barren hills,
building tea plantations,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.600
and benefiting the local people.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.390
I learned the 18 Dragon Movements

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.620
during my practice

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:35.000
from my fellow disciples at Ganlu Temple.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.070
Monks do not hoard their knowledge.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.510
Lady Rong, if you like them,

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.370
you can send people to learn them.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.440
The Ganlu Tea today

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.000
has such a translucent hue,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.600
and a richer chestnut aroma.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.040
There is a 300-year-old well

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.920
in the backyard
of the temple where I practiced.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.880
It's always covered with

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.940
a heavy stone slab.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.730
The slab is covered with moss.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.550
For some unknown reason,

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.590
it rains whenever the slab is lifted,

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.230
and the rain stops
when the slab is replaced.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:16.890
This attracts many visitors.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.190
When the tea

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.110
is brewed with water from this well,

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.570
the tea will be
more fragrant and flavorful.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:28.190
Bao,

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.680
it's a real privilege
that Mr. Yan is willing to teach you.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.430
You must learn attentively.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.240
Yes.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.660
Do you think Mr. Yan resembles him?

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.630
Not really.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.330
That's what I think too.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.030
But Mr. Yan is

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.560
a well-mannered young man.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:32.500
It's fine

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.670
that they're not alike.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.030
Mr. Yan, you're truly selfless,

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:42.630
sharing all your knowledge.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.920
However, here in Linji,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.050
we lack that well with its sweet water,

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.900
so we probably can't make

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.760
such uniquely flavored tea.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:53.870
Why are you laughing, Mr. Yan?

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.170
I'm laughing at myself.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.800
I was

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.110
supposed to take my vows

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:02.440
and become a monk today.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.800
My father sent men to cut off

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.730
all food supplies to the mountain.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.350
If I hadn't come down,

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.630
he would have starved

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.630
all the monks in the temple to death.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.590
I'm sorry. I had no idea...

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.520
I truly believed

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.390
my devotion to Buddha was unshakable.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.190
So before coming here, I told myself

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.240
that if the Rong family forced me

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.600
to marry you against my will,

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.070
I would rather die

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.690
than ruin years of my practice

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.190
and break the vows

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.390
I made before Buddha.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.810
But upon seeing you, I finally realized

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.230
that I am just

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.190
a very ordinary

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.400
man in this world,

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.030
so I cannot

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.960
continue serving Buddha anymore.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.070
What have you done wrong, Mr. Yan?

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.030
I see the prayer flags fluttering
in the wind.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.340
But it is not the fault of the wind,

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.280
nor is it the fault of the flags.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:15.030
All the fault

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.970
lies within myself.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.350
Mr. Yan

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.150
is truly like an unsolvable puzzle.
