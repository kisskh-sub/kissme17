00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.280
The Sovereign is back!

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.760
Your Grace!

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.150
Your Grace is back!

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.520
Your Grace!

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.460
Your Grace!

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.880
Your Grace!

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.920
This way.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.240
Your Grace! Your Grace!

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.120
Why is an immortal at his side?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.480
Will she be our Queen?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.590
Not everyone can become our Queen.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.040
Ridiculous!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.000
Your Grace,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.150
the Blossom-Dyeing Festival begins!

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.480
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.870
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.200
What does the festival mean?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.680
Where do you get

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.480
all these flowers?

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.070
Whenever a great celebration occurs,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
we demons channel power

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.350
to dye withered grass with colors.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.890
This is the Blossom-Dyeing Festival.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.230
But dyeing blossoms drains energy,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.680
so it's rarely done.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.430
What has happened

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.000
to make you go to such lengths?

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.230
It's a great affair

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.640
for the demon clan and me.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.560
I'm a little tired;

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.200
I'll rest first.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.080
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.290
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.400
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.240
With blossoms dyed...

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.030
The Sovereign arranged

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.710
the Demon Fruit specially for you.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.750
Why are you holding

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.480
a Blossom-Dyeing Festival today?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.280
It was never this grand before.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.980
Today, the Sovereign

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.150
has planned for a long time;

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.560
it's for the demon clan's cause.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.560
And that cause is

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.710
to invade the Immortal Realm?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.030
You knew the answer.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.430
The Sovereign is giving himself

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.870
to you for that very goal.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.000
The immortals are sick

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.080
and helpless.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.190
Of course, we celebrate

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.000
because we're about to triumph.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.630
Have you never considered

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.100
peace between the two realms?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.990
Peace?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.030
The immortals are sick and weak.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.080
The Sovereign returned
to prepare for war.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.750
In the last war,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.800
when we saw your kind,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.150
we longed to tear your flesh alive.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.720
The talk of peace is absurd.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.430
You're an immortal, too.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.750
How can there be peace?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.750
Give her the things.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.590
Let's go.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.430
(An ordinary demon soldier
can see the truth.)

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.000
(Why must I keep deceiving myself?)

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.630
(Do I have to hear it)

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.430
(from his lips before I wake up?)

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.790
You're here.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.590
Jie Chuan,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.870
let's drink.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800
What's happening?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.040
That day in the Wasteland cave,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.360
I heard your plan clearly.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.510
The immortals are in danger

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.680
because of you.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.360
Yet you act as if nothing happened

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.600
beside me.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.640
Jie Chuan,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.310
I don't know you at all.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.510
You frighten me.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.880
Ji Li,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.040
you doubt me

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.360
because of a few immortal rumors?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.040
What have I done

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.750
to deserve such cruelty?

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.270
It's not a doubt.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.000
I saw with my eyes

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.920
and heard with my ears.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.670
What?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.390
I only need your Demonic Ether
to save them.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.680
Once the immortals are healed,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.040
everything between us

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.390
will be settled.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.830
We'll be even.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.760
Whether it's the Demon Realm

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.190
or Wasteland,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.800
I'll treat the days and nights we shared

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.120
as nothing but a beautiful dream.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.230
Your Grace!

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920
Ji Li!

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.560
Am I truly such a man

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.600
in your heart?

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.070
You think a mere Spirit Sensor

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.120
can subdue me?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:57.670
Your Grace,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.120
kill her at once!

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.240
This is all an immortal plot.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.240
They've poisoned our realm;

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.040
every plant in the Forbidden Land

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.560
is dead or dying.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.430
I thought we only wanted
his Demonic Ether.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.120
Why are their plants withering?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.480
The demons stormed the Immortal Realm.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.190
How can we not avenge this?

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.710
Today,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.480
we destroy Jie Chuan

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.070
and the entire demon clan!

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.000
Ji Li,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.480
I've reported your merit today

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.070
to Feng Tian.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.600
You may leave Wasteland.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.830
She achieved so much.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.120
That's clearly not enough!

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.230
Ji Li,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.190
your souls are bound;

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.190
only you can wound him.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.750
Do it.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.070
Master,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.200
I...

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.390
Take the sword.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.230
I...

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.870
Jie Chuan!

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.120
He's become

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.790
a Demon Deity!

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.160
How?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.000
Thanks for helping me

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.840
shatter love's chains.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.120
To show my gratitude,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.320
I shall raze the Immortal Realm

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.240
in three days.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.600
Plotting against the Sovereign?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000
You've outfoxed yourselves.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.870
You self-righteous hypocrites

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.040
should repent

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.270
in the dungeon later.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.350
Master.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.850
Still unwilling to leave?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.080
Master!

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.030
Master!

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.870
Ji Li...

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.560
Ji Li...

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.030
Master,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.440
you're still thinking

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.550
about her?

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.630
If not for her,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.240
you'd never be like this.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.710
Huan Zhen?

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.480
Where is Ji Li?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.080
Jie Chuan...

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.240
He hates her to the bone.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.360
He'll show no mercy.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.080
Go back and report

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.440
that Jie Chuan has ascended,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.000
and he'll march on us.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.720
I will save Ji Li.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.150
No!

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.840
Master, you're too weak.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.790
You must rest.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.800
Master,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.870
the immortals used you;

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.790
Ji Li saw only Jie Chuan.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.150
You're gravely hurt.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.840
Why not find some hidden place

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.910
and leave these wars behind with me?

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.390
An immortal's duty

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.390
is the safety of the Immortal Realm.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.360
If you cannot grasp that,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.030
leave at once.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.240
Jie Chuan, bad news!

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960
Hong Zhua has fled.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.840
Our forces are mustered.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.390
Before he can warn them,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.080
we storm the Immortal Realm.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.800
They say

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.030
their barrier cannot be breached

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.480
without the key.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.360
The last assault failed

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.670
because we couldn't

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.510
break through.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.680
Now,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.870
to win in one strike,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.960
we must find the way through,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.280
or victory

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.800
is impossible.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.150
Ji Li is Hong Zhua's disciple.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.320
She should know

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.550
how to break that barrier.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.470
Understood.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.030
Hong Zhua is wounded.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.000
He can't save you.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.560
You'd better

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.390
tell us

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.750
the barrier's weakness at once,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.360
or don't blame me

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.870
for being rough.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.710
Stop.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.440
I have my own way

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.550
to break through that barrier.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.320
You will watch

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.240
demon legions shatter it.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.150
Your Grace,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.960
an immortal named Huan Zhen
seeks audience.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960
She claims she can reveal

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.870
the secret to breaking the barrier.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.990
Huan Zhen?

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.550
The war is coming.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.200
You

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.390
are all veteran demons.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.910
This campaign

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
must succeed.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.030
(Their wounds
from the last war still fester.)

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.270
(I must borrow Devourer's strength;)

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.630
(after victory,)

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.960
(they can heal.)

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.510
(Only when desire is torn out)

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.480
(can we trample the immortals.)

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.870
Everyone,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.120
the key to the barrier is in our grasp.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.440
The Sovereign

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.670
has finally decided to strike.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.390
In the last great war,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.000
you've earned great merit.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.840
Now,

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.120
our clan

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.720
has started anew

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.230
to attack the immortals again!

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.720
We'll surely win

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.120
against the immortals!

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.390
We'll surely win

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.870
against the immortals!

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.630
You've been lying to me all along.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.080
Why didn't you just kill me?

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.240
All those vows

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.200
and promises are lies!

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.510
Listen.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.960
Your Grace,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.800
we have won.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:57.630
