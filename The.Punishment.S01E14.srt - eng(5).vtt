00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.070
But Ji Zhujiang

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.550
has no idea who these people actually are.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.480
All he knows is

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.000
that they only take orders
from one person,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.800
who is usually

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.550
referred to as "Boss."

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.190
I think

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.660
this person is probably related

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.750
to the Xu Li case.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.060
They have a strict hierarchy...

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.160
What kind of person...

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.290
could this "Boss" be?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.080
No matter who this person is,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.000
how powerful and how deeply

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.260
concealed he or she is,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.000
we must root this culprit out.

Ye,

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.870
Qin Feng

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.880
is quite good.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.400
He made great contributions
to the case about Ma Jin and Luo Bo.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.800
He deserves a promotion,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.030
to deputy chief

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.160
or even chief.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.050
He stands a high chance of both.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.910
It depends on his performance.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.210
The case is closed.

Why not go back to the provincial office?

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.730
I'm afraid not.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.150
As I told you,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.750
I'm like a falling leave
returning to my roots.

worked for one person,

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.740
who he had never met.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.030
Despite all that time searching,

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.030
we've got no lead.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.590

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.080

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.090

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.570

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.780
Why tire yourself out?

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.750
Exactly because retirement is approaching,

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.560
I'd hate to leave the force with regrets.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.480
I must catch this mastermind,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.700
or I can't face my mentees.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.360

It surely was.

of Director Ye to send me

as an undercover cop.

So,

You should talk to Ziyi first, right?

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.550
Before your father proposed marriage,

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.210
he asked for my opinion first.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.880
Well, Dad asked you,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.790
so I chose to ask you too.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.550
is very tolerant.

than what the two of you think.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.080
then you shouldn't rush.

However,

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.690
I want you to remember one thing.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.960
That is, raising your own small family

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.160
and managing the big community of Longwan

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.420
are actually the same.

If you are to earn respect and trust

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.580
from everyone,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.880
then you must constantly make real efforts

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.700
and try convincing others.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.480
When Ziyi marries you,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.440
she'll become

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.550
part of our family.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.690

her care for you is not

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.640
something to take granted for.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.350
You must earn that

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.400
by caring for her too.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.720

Make sure you try your best
to build a life with her.

Yes.

Who's going to grab that?

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:10.930

Grab one!

No, I'm not.

You can really hold your liquor.

Okay.

How long have you known Yan?

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.350
Since high school.
We went to high school together.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.350
That early?

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.830
Yes.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.780
When did you two start dating?

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.810
A-About six months ago.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.200
Six months already.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.690
How many girlfriends
did you have before her?

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.110
Two.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.680
Why did you break up with them?

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.000
One

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.480
went abroad.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.230
The other one...

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.770
fought with me a lot.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.270
So you didn't do anything wrong, right?

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.880
You were not responsible for the breakups?

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.480
Well,

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.110
not exactly.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.910
I-I'm sure I was partly to blame.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.220
What did your ex-girlfriends

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.600
mostly fight you about?

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.250
They thought...

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.200
that I...

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.860
couldn't make much money,

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.680
and...

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.400
that I was never home
due to my job as a journalist.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.240
I could rarely

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.750

lovable and pretty.

What are your plans for the future?

My plans...

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.210
are surely to

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.090
keep dating her.

No, no, no.

That's not a proper way to put it.

to the next level soon.

try building a stable home for Yan.

this young fellow genuinely loves Yan.

Yes.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.720
The purpose of this talk
is to let you know

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.310
that Yan has us two brothers,

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.270
and that if you don't treat her right,

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.460
we'll hunt you down.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.920
T-That won't happen.

That said, Yan also

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.040
has her flaws

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.130
and shortcomings.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.950
Sometimes when she gets hot-tempered,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.600
she might be a bit mean to you.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.200
Just be tolerant

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.880
and process it yourself.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.070
We just hope

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.400
to never hear

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.750

No, they didn't.

And you, silly,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.350
Why didn't you say no
when they made you drink?

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.090
Who made him drink? Did you?

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.510
I drank at my own will.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.640
Drink less if you can't hold your liquor.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.230

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.920
I recall it.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.350
They're mine.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.810
Are you running them alone?

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.190
Yes, all by myself.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:46.630
Sir...

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.120
I'm not finished yet.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.020
They belong to He Gang.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.530
I'm just watching them for him.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.200
The dens belong to him only?

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.000
No.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.970
They belong to his brother He Biao too,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.190
who owns the Grand Paradise.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.030
Sir, sir, sir,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.000
this is all I know.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.510
I...

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.340
I've told you everything.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.690
Do you know who Ma Jin is?

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.550
Mr. Ma?

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.750
Those gambling dens used to be Mr. Ma's,

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.880
but then somehow they fell

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.880
into the hands of He Biao and He Gang.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.320
This is really all I know, sir.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.590
I-I'm just

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:21.670
a nobody.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.670
Sir, calm down.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.110
Have a cigarette.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.860
Stop being mad.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.840
I'll ask around for you.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.190
Is that okay, sir?

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.920
H-How should I call you, sir?

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.850
What do you mean?

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.580
You're asking my name, right?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.600
I'll just ask around for you.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.280
I mean nothing else.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.760
What's going on with these two?

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.630
I hit them each once,
and now they're like this?

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.960
Both of you, get up! Hurry!

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.280
Nothing serious.
I'm bleeding but still fine.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:48.840
Get up!

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.710
Can you walk?

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.310
Yes, I can.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:51.880
Are you sure?

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.010
I'm perfectly fine.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:53.880
Good.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.150
I'll come to you if I need anything.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.880
Sure, sir.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.630
Take care, sir!

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.220
Here, Hongbao.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.040
Oh, Mr. Bao!

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:14.760
Mr. Bao!

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.560
What happened to you?

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.500
Si, tidy up the place.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.080
Give me some tissues.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.630
Mr. Bao,

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.760
it's me, Jiu.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.140
Si is back!

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.400
Look.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.880
Look who's back.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.130
[Mr. Bao, Su Hongbao's Boss]

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.790
You've recognized him.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.720
You really have.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.190
Wasn't it just a fall?

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.760
How did he

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.960
end up like this?

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.630
It was all because of Ma Jin.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.440
Mr. Bao had a cerebral hemorrhage

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.630
and nearly died.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.150
Our brothers all chipped in to help him.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.600
That was how he survived.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.090
We're still in debt now.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:13.760
Mr. Bao, I'm back.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.320
Don't worry.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.840
I will get back

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:21.760
what should be ours.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.550
Then I'll get you proper treatment.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:26.420
Hongbao,

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.070
[Wu Si, A Henchman of Su Hongbao's]

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.570
I waited so long for you to say that.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.150
After suffering for so many years,

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.760
I can't take it anymore.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.360
We must make a big move
before we get too old for it.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.280
Jiu!

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.630
Close that restaurant of yours.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:39.710
Let's all work together.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.320
Si,

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.330
things are difficult for me.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.030
Hongbao,

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.670
truth to be told,

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.510
I'm in poor health now.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.360
I just want to keep running my restaurant,

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.480
make a living,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.280
and live a stable life.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.210
It's okay.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.110
People pursue different things.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.760
Go buy Mr. Bao

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.870
some fruit then.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.880
Hongbao, there's money on me.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.140
I'll go buy some fruit.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:15.030
What a coward.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.840
Jiu was cowardly before,
and now he's even more so.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.370
Hongbao,

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.080
the two of us can make a proper team
without him.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.510
Mr. Bao, easy, easy.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.840
This is Hongbao.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.590
Si.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:29.680
Look into

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.590
He Biao and He Gang.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.840
Figure out their backgrounds.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.640
I think someone's backing them.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.510
By the way,

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.880
Lin didn't die.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.400
Lin didn't die.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.200
Think of something.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.630
Try...

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.880
if you can get his contact.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.360
Qin,

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.420
something came up.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.550
Okay. What is it?

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.400
Didn't you ask me to keep

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.000
close watch on Lin's home,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.200
who worked for Ma Jin?

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.280
All was quiet until a few days ago,

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.000
someone came find him.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.840
Who was it?

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.000
A man named Su Hongbao. I looked into him.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.260
He's an ex-con who just got out of prison.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.960
Do you need me to dig deeper?

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.110
I know this guy.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.960
You know him?

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.550
It was I who arrested him.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:23.920
It's okay.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.130
Leave this to me.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.820
He's not your problem now.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.240
Alright.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:39.660
[In loving memory
of my beloved daughter Qian Yuhong]

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.880
Yuhong,

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.480
how time flies.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:48.710
In the blink of an eye,

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.400
we've been apart for 2 years.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.210
In dreams I forget I'm just a visitor,

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.130
yet waking feels like I'm still dreaming.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.000
[In loving memory
of my beloved daughter Qian Yuhong]

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Oh, right, Muzhi,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.500
someone's secretly running gambling dens
behind our backs.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.300
Shouldn't we teach him a lesson?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.510
Don't all the gambling dens in Hanzhou

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:10.960
belong to the He family?

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.310
Secretly running gambling dens
behind our backs?

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.710
Is it because I, He Muzhi, have been

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.640
appearing too refined in public lately?

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.640
Yeah.

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.420
But it's a bit tricky

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.240
to deal with this person.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.600
It's Liu Tianfei.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:28.570
Muzhi,

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.270
your tactics to manage people
aren't working well.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.640
They all seem defiant.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.320
Liu Tianfei...
