(Human Skeleton Found Inside Stone Lion)
a hidden underbelly in Binchuan,

or an injustice that never cleared up?

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.240
The driver responsible for the crash
has been identified,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.630
but the motive is still unclear.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.600
And the identity of the remains

Everyone, what we're dealing with

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.480
is more than just a traffic accident.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.800
What matters is

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.680
that we get to the bottom

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.190
of the truth behind it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.630
(Penglai Plaza belongs to
the Penglai Group.)

(Over the past few years,)

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.630

But every investigation
came up short of hard evidence.

00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:48.200
I believe this crash is unlikely
to be a coincidence.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.310
For this case,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.266
the provincial department
has issued instructions

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:53.950
to conduct
a comprehensive investigation,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.111
verify every lead,

00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:57.630
and punish offenders
strictly according to the law.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.390
In one week,

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.510
we must confirm
the identity of the remains

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.700

I'm with the municipal
criminal investigation unit.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.600
We've set up a task force

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.430

Why didn't you tell me earlier?

As if it would've helped.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.950
You're gone eight months a year.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.720
Should I count on you for money?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.733
Or for you to come back
and look after him?

00:08:00.622 --> 00:08:02.711
We found out after the Chinese New Year.

00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:05.830
What else do you want to ask?

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.390
Gao Feng,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.430
your dad is dead.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.270
Don't you have anything to say?

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.480

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.600
Fine.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.622
If you won't speak, I will.

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:34.311
From now on, if you don't want
to come back, then don't.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.533
I have my pension.
I can get by on my own.

00:08:38.022 --> 00:08:40.111
You don't need to
send money back anymore.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.910
Keep it for yourself.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.600
You never liked staying here anyway.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.790
Go hiking or anything.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.440
Do whatever you like.

00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:51.800
Just don't mess up

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.390
that I have to go identify your body!

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.030
Mom.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.910
Foster mother.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.750
When I get old and can't walk anymore,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.870
I'll go to a nursing home.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.270
I'll just pretend I never raised...

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.820
(Funeral)

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.360
You and your dad, that's it then.

00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:26.177
I'm not leaving for the time being.

00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:30.888
After I finish dealing with
the old man's funeral,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.960
I'll stay.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.960
I'll book you a body checkup later.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.320
We'll figure out

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.320
what to do later.

00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:23.022
You're finally free now?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.750
I paid three months of rent for you.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.120
Pay me back.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.150
Take it out of my paycheck next month.

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:38.111
You need someone to run the grill,
right?

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.000
I'll do it.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.480
Do you even believe what you're saying?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.670
You work two months, save some money,

00:10:44.688 --> 00:10:46.333
and then you take off traveling again.

00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:47.977
Who am I supposed to get the money from?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.720
I'm not lying. I'm not leaving for now.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.390
Gao Feng,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.910
we're

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.910
done now.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.390
It's not that.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.200
I think something feels off

00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:07.440
about the old man's death.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.550
Su Min.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.390
It's me.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.630
Are you insane?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.670
Testing me this late at night?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.200
I need to talk to you.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.550
Did you go home?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.080
I did.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.270
I didn't see you.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.320
Didn't you use to go to
the old man's food stall every day?

00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:30.270
You said his cooking tasted like home.

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:33.330
He called you his godson.
Why didn't you show up at his funeral?

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:35.510
Stop running around all the time.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.222
Spend more time with your mom.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.630
The old man

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.030
didn't die of illness, right?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.980
(His good name lives on.
His good spirit endures.)

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Well,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.750
I must clean you up nicely.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.720
So you don't complain
to the King of Hell

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.750
about having a lazy wife.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.000
You frigging Gao Dahua!

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.480
Tell me what happened.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.480
It's been ruled out as a criminal case.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.600
How did Gao Dahua die?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.480
Stop calling him

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.750
by his name.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.840
Who's Gao Dahua to you?

00:13:32.133 --> 00:13:34.511
He just passed away.
Why are you making a fuss here?

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.440
Wait.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.240
If Gao Dahua died of illness,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.911
you wouldn't be telling me all this.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.840
Something's wrong.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.320
We have rules.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.390
Fine. I'll look into it myself.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.390
Don't be ridiculous.

00:13:50.555 --> 00:13:52.533
You really think
you're an auxiliary police?

00:13:53.444 --> 00:13:54.733
Gao Feng, stand there.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.200
Stop right there.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.150
Gao Feng, ask yourself honestly.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.390
Are you really doing this
because you care about Mr. Gao?

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.790
Listen to me.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.200
He's gone. Let it go.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.670
Your family needs a man.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.480
Stop drifting around.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.910
Get to the point.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.840
How did he die?

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.320
Dying of illness wasn't bad enough?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.790
Don't brush me off.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.333
You know what kind of person I am.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:44.860
(His good name lives on.
His good spirit endures.)

00:14:57.222 --> 00:14:59.400
Cancer patients go through
tremendous pain at the end.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.320
It's unbearable.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.355
(Death Certificate)
If you don't believe me, go in and look.

00:15:02.355 --> 00:15:03.933
He scraped the paint off the walls.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.670
He drank paraquat and died.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.790
I'm a light sleeper.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.720
That night, I took a sleeping pill.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.030
But Gao Feng,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.510
I'm actually glad

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.030
you asked this yourself.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.960
At least

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.910
you still care about him.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.600
The old man loved to drink.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.720
He wasn't himself after drinking.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.320
He hit you, cursed at you,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.790
and even hurt you.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.000
Now that he's gone,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.030
I'll tell you what he never said.

00:15:58.311 --> 00:16:00.977
He was dead set against you
going to the police academy back then.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.790
He said you were

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.777
trying to use a public job
to track down your birth parents.

00:16:04.933 --> 00:16:07.200
Your motive wasn't right,
and you couldn't be a cop.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.022
(You hid my household register,
didn't you?)

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.270
Gao Dahua,
you're trying to fool me again?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.150
Let go!

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.200
As long as I'm alive,

00:16:18.533 --> 00:16:20.688
don't even think about
applying to the police academy.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.750
Forget about becoming a cop.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.320
Stop wasting your effort.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.790
You just want to use the job

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.790
to look for your biological parents,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.080
right?

00:16:31.088 --> 00:16:32.790
You're scared
I'd become a cop and dig into you?

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.720
You scoundrel!

00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:36.555
(You know where my mother was
and kept it from me all this time!)

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.840
(You scoundrel!)

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.270
(That's not how it was.)

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.360
You know how he met Su Min.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.510
Su Min's parents were police officers.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.270
(They were killed
right in front of his food stall.)

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.750
(Your dad only wanted you to be safe.)

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.510
Is that wrong?

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.480
Calling it suicide sounds awful.

00:17:06.244 --> 00:17:07.750
Throughout your dad's whole life,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.750
aside from his bad temper,

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.720
he was an upright man.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.480
I've never asked you for much.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.920
If you will do me this favor,

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.030
don't tell anyone about his suicide.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.720
Tell people he died of an illness.

00:17:25.355 --> 00:17:26.555
Will you do that for me?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.480
He's the one who raised you.

00:17:40.555 --> 00:17:41.550
Have some conscience.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.510
See him off properly tomorrow, okay?

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.400
(An orphan has three birthdays.)

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.960
(The first one is
given by someone else.)

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.000
(Gao Dahua picked it for me.)

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.044
(He said it was the day
he brought me home.)

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.750
(I never)

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.000
(took that seriously.)

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.790
(My foster father said)

00:18:22.155 --> 00:18:24.550
(I was abandoned by my birth parents
the day I was born.)

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.790
(But after I grew up,
I remembered a melody.)

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.880
(I was sure
it was my birth mother's voice.)

00:18:34.355 --> 00:18:37.030
(People can remember things
from when they were two or three.)

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.311
(My foster father said
it was all in my head.)

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.030
(I think)

00:18:44.155 --> 00:18:45.955
(you can do this job better than I.)

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:50.920
Are you trying to talk me into it again?

00:18:51.044 --> 00:18:52.890
You can't just drift around
like this forever.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.720
You've got to settle into a proper job.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.960
I did try.

00:18:58.533 --> 00:19:00.155
I applied to the police academy.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.480
You knew that.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.160
Tell me the truth about my mother.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.270
I'll go find a decent job,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.790
and be a good son, okay?

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.790
Stop listening to that nonsense.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.200
Do you really think

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.350
I don't know anything?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
When I was five, I said
I wanted to look for my mother.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.350
You beat me up.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.830
You were drunk.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.920
You were mumbling to yourself,
and I heard every word.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:31.510
Do you really think

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.680
I don't remember any of it?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.070
You said my mother suffered so much
to give birth to me.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.510
If I were a baby you picked up,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.440
how would you know
what she went through?

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:43.480
You've been lying to yourself
your whole life.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.510
And now you want me
to live like that too?

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.400
Why should I?

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.790
Because I'm your father!

00:19:52.555 --> 00:19:54.066
You're my foster father.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.200
(He wasn't a clever man.)

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.510
(Sometimes he let things slip.)

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:06.640
(That's how I knew)

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.240
(he was lying to me.)

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.160
(The second birthday is the one
an orphan chooses for himself.)

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.590
(I chose April 1st.)

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.200
(That birthday)

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.200
(is there to remind me)

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.030
(that I was fooled.)

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.550
(The third birthday is
an orphan's real birthday.)

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.400
(That's the question about who I am.)

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.480
(Who am I?
I've been chasing for thirty years.)

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.960
(I may never get the answer.)

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.350
You're Gao Feng?

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.640
Gao Dahua is your dad, right?

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.480
Who are you?

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:48.880
The police won't let me say.

00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:50.200
But I think you deserve to know.

00:20:50.311 --> 00:20:51.790
Your father didn't die of illness.

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:25.580
(Death Certificate: The deceased
died by suicide due to other causes.)

00:21:39.422 --> 00:21:40.880
Have you got any common courtesy?

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.310
The music's blaring.

00:21:44.288 --> 00:21:46.355
There's something wrong
with Gao Dahua's death.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.480
It was suicide,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.790
but not because of his illness.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.240
Care to explain?

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.200
Why do you think that?

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.350
It says "other causes," not illness.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.333
(Due to other causes.)
(The time also doesn't match.)

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.680
(If it were suicide caused by illness,)

00:22:17.088 --> 00:22:19.066
they wouldn't need three days
to look into it.

00:22:19.133 --> 00:22:20.920
(That woman said the police
went to see her.)

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.933
(If Gao Dahua couldn't
take the pain anymore,)

00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:24.666
(it wouldn't drag
other people into this.)

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.790
I asked Su Min.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.070
And I asked the old lady today.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.110
Her story

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.830
sounded rehearsed,

00:22:32.866 --> 00:22:34.622
like she'd been prepared for me.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.160
Su Min called her the moment he saw me.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.400
I checked her phone.

00:22:41.311 --> 00:22:42.822
There's something going on here.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.400
Everyone's keeping things from me.

00:22:54.511 --> 00:22:56.333
When this place was being renovated,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.310
we were still together.

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.066
I thought you were someone

00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:07.644
who didn't care about anything.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.270
Turns out

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:11.977
you care quite a lot
about your foster father.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.750
What I care about

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.590
is the answer he kept buried inside.

00:23:20.288 --> 00:23:22.311
The way he died was far from normal.

00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:24.177
It must have something to do with me.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.680
Was he running away, was he afraid,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.960
or something else?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.680
It's nice

00:23:32.266 --> 00:23:33.866
to have someone you care about.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.510
You probably won't get what I'm saying.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.030
You have parents.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.510
Having them doesn't mean you care.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.000
And caring doesn't mean you have them.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.220

(You kept looking around.)

00:26:45.355 --> 00:26:46.511
(What was going on with you?)

00:27:00.977 --> 00:27:03.044
(Taxi)
Dong, don't try to brush me off.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.830
What else do you know about Gao Dahua?

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.640
(The stone lion exploded on Monday.)

00:27:10.888 --> 00:27:12.866
(The cabbie group chat
said it was bad luck,)

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.200
(so everyone took the day off.)

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.750
(Around noon, Mr. Gao called me.)

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.240
Mr. Gao, someone died today.
It's chaos out there.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720
Don't go out.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.440
Songjiang Garden.

00:27:27.888 --> 00:27:29.777
What are you going there for, Mr. Gao?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.790
Are you meeting

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.200
some old lady to dance?

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:34.550
Dong,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.750
when you come to eat at my place,

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.070
I'll give you extra meat.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.350
Alright, Mr. Gao.

00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:04.270
(He got out of the car
when we reached Songjiang Garden.)

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.310
That's all I know.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.160
Civil servant.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.420
(Matchmaking Corner)

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.680
That's good.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.110
Very well. Take this phone number.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.577
Ladies, stop dancing for a moment.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.680
(Reward Offered, Seeking Info.)
Over there too.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.480
(Reward for any clues.)
People at the matchmaking corner,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.310
please gather around.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.880
Sir, stop playing for a bit.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.160
Please gather around here.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.350
We're offering a reward.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.830
A devoted son is looking for
his father's old friends.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.000
Any leads are welcome.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.750
- Gao Dahua was a cook.
- Gao Dahua?

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:44.960
I don't know this man.

00:28:44.977 --> 00:28:47.111
If you've eaten at his food stall,
you'll remember him.

00:28:47.111 --> 00:28:47.880
Please ask around.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.750
Please ask around. You'll recognize him.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.830
Are you offering a reward?

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.110
Yeah.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.000
Be careful!

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.240
Gao Feng!

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.550
You're wearing me out.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.030
I drank too much yesterday.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.110
I hit you hard.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.070
From now on, I won't stop you

00:30:46.155 --> 00:30:47.688
from looking for your parents.

00:30:48.022 --> 00:30:49.666
Just don't run around on your own.

00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:52.088
(There are traffickers out there.)

00:30:52.488 --> 00:30:54.800
(Your mother suffered so much
to give birth to you.)

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.510
(Don't let yourself get taken away.)

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.550
You hear me?

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.440
What exactly

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.310
are you investigating?

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.680
Gao Feng, go home and see your dad off.

00:32:25.244 --> 00:32:27.288
Your mom has something to say to you.

00:32:32.288 --> 00:32:34.440
(Police Report Receipt)
Gao Dahua had another woman.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.510
I only found out a few months ago.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.830
He gave her one hundred thousand yuan
a few days before he passed.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.030
That money was
for his final round of chemotherapy.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.270
It's all written in this report.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.590
We suspect the woman was a scammer.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.310
The police will handle

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.310
the money issue.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.720
Don't worry.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.000
Alright.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.350
Call Dong and the others in.
It's time to see your dad off.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.960
You're all trying to fool me, huh?

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.169
Gao Dahua spent his whole life
cooking at a stove.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.440
You're telling me he had an affair?

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.160
Gao Feng.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.880
Your generation

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.240
treats reputation like it's everything.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.920
You'd even make up a lie like this.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.550
What are you really hiding from me?

00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:36.920
This has something to do with me,
doesn't it?

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.640
Gao Feng.

00:33:38.155 --> 00:33:40.444
That woman is my biological mother,
right?

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.350
My mom came to look for me, right?

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.750
She came to find me, right?

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.830
He's dead.

00:33:44.933 --> 00:33:46.680
What could be more important than that?

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.920
What I care about is how he died!

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.550
What was he afraid of
that he had to hide the way he died?

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.680
You scoundrel!

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.920
Madam Zhang.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.400
Go outside

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.110
and see if everything's ready.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.280
It's alright.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.710
Don't worry.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.000
Did the woman who gave birth to you

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.510
even want you?

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.710
Do you know what she looks like?

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.070
Is she really that perfect in your eyes?

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.550
Did she never do anything wrong?

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.800
Gao Feng,

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.230
just see your dad off properly,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.800
please.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.030
Let me talk to him alone.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.480
Please.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.940
(Hearse)

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.760
Old man,

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.400
we never saw eye to eye.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.550
I know

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.670
you probably wished

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.030
that just once, I'd call you dad

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.440
loud and clear

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.200
in front of family and friends.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.630
I'm sorry.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.710
I just can't say it.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.840
You worked yourself to the bone

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.840
to raise me.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.400
(But why)

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.360
(did you always)

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:30.920
(dodge my questions?)

00:36:32.733 --> 00:36:33.840
(I won't get the chance)

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.480
(to repay you.)

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:38.960
(Still,)

00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:41.488
(I have to see you off
on your last journey.)

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.150
(Old man...)

00:36:44.888 --> 00:36:46.000
(Rest in peace.)

00:37:32.777 --> 00:37:34.150
(Your dad didn't die of illness.)

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.510
(He drank paraquat and died.)

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.190
(That's not true.)

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.170
(But if anyone asks,
tell them he died of illness.)

00:37:39.177 --> 00:37:40.666
(No. I think you deserve to know.)

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.230
(The police will
handle the money issue.)

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.444
(The police won't let me say.)

00:37:44.466 --> 00:37:45.360
(Something is off.)

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.320
(Not a big deal,
but it's humiliating if it gets out.)

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.400
(Are you doing this
because you care about Mr. Gao?)

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.510
(He's gone. Let it go.)

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:07.180
(Taxi)

00:38:07.222 --> 00:38:09.580
This car's been parked by
Songjiang Garden the whole time.

00:38:09.644 --> 00:38:10.670
It hasn't moved, right?

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.550
No.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.880
If I'm right,

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.840
we may already have the answer.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.670
Really?

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.800
Get off.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.920
Mr. Gao's lover was there?

00:38:30.955 --> 00:38:32.590
Whether she was his lover, I don't know.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.190
But she's been following me.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.230
So when you had me shouting at the park,

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:39.880
that was a smokescreen.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.230
Feng, that's...

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.960
Keep it down.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.400
Look at his.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.880
Parking fees at Songjiang Garden
are expensive.

00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:51.510
Would a cabbie stop there to rest?

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.590
No way.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.030
Feng.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.150
What is it?

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.190
Feng!

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.400
That's the car.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.800
Go. Go after it.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.030
Where is she?

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.480
She got out.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.030
She had me drive around to stall you.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.320
You think you could've caught me?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
What did she look like?

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.070
Where did she get out?

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.440
She paid me.

00:40:45.488 --> 00:40:46.760
I've got to keep my mouth shut.

00:40:47.155 --> 00:40:48.320
But she did say one thing.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.190
Everything you want to know
is inside here

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.150
and at the stone lion.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.340
(Taxi)

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:24.540
(Guess who you are.)

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.360
(When I was a kid,)

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.320
(I heard all kinds of stories
about the stone lion.)

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.710
(Some said)

00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:34.710
(you could hear the college entrance
exam essay topics inside.)

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:36.400
(Some said)

00:41:36.844 --> 00:41:38.760
(you could hear
the winning lottery numbers.)

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.670
(Others said)

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.710
(you could hear messages from the dead.)

00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:46.777
(But all of that is just about
what people want to know.)

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360
(Maybe what's in there)

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.400
(is also the answer
I've been looking for.)

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.660
