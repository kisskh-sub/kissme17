Why is the head covered?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.760
Take it off.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.640
We're legitimate business people.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.310
They went too far.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.240
Sorry.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.800
Tell us your demands.

Let the girls decide.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.560
If they don't want to work,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.750
let them go.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.750
If they all left,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.710
our club would have to shut down.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.680
Everyone would starve.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.360
Women can survive in many ways.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.360
Survive with dignity.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.150
You're a scholar.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.800
From ancient times to now,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.280
tell me what ways

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.430
allow women to live with dignity.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.360
Only someone like you

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.030
doesn't care about their lives.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.990
Don't waste time talking to him.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.430
He's an idiot.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.400
Just kick him out.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.960
You caused quite a scene this afternoon.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.030
Even the police called
to check what happened.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.150
We spent ages smoothing things over.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.430
I heard you wanted
to write an article too.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.470
The impact is severe.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.120
To undo it...

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.710
He Xiaohong, bring it in.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.800
You did all this

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.680
just because you like Qu Meng.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.910
But

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.470
your affection could harm her.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.830
You've seen it too.

(Lottery)
The lottery is for guests.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.720
Qu Meng is already assistant team leader.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.630
Her ball didn't need to go in.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.120
But after what you did,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.720
I can't control my people.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.510
So I have no choice.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.720
I can only do this.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.680
Take it down for the guests to draw.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.510
I did this.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.430
Let Qu Meng go.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.240
Spare her. Come at me!

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.750
Four guests still need to draw.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.310
One ball for four draws then.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.360
Kneel.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.830

Go.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.720
If there's anything, tell me.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.830
Don't make things hard for her.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.430
First,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.800
go to the police station.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.870
Admit you spread rumors about the hotel.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.920
how you got the face injury,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.000
say you fell after drinking too much.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.510
You've suffered.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.720
Leave Binchuan.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.920

Can you tell me your name?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.630
My name is Qu Meng.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.870
Qu, like a song.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.360
Meng, like a dream.

your biological mom might have

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.240
been at International Club back then.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.790
The old man indeed worked

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.910
as a chef there.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.030
The police have uncovered this.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.790
You'll find out sooner or later.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.670
I think

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.390
I should tell you first.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.360
I bought beef this afternoon.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.990
We'll have braised beef for dinner.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.320
It'll be ready soon.

You...

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.240
You don't blame me?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.320
It happened a long time ago.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.870
We both know very well

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.290
that I want to get to the bottom of this.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.440
Now that we know
the old man's connection,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.910
it's like another piece of the puzzle.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.360
I'm one step closer to the truth.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.440
Why would I blame you?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.960

Why not just live our own lives?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.080

I…

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.600
I don't care.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.600
But now I live in fear every day.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.510
Do you know?

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.200
Do you know what it feels like to have
your heart in your throat every day?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.080
I wish

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.200
I could tie you to me every day.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.270
I heard people say

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.600
some children come to this world

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.750
to repay a debt.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.790
And some

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.550
come to collect debt.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.080
I'm sorry.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.790
I might be the unlucky one

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.510
coming to collect a debt.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.200
Lately,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.720

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.790
I heard

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.200
some people pay a lot of money

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.290
to buy newspaper
published on the day they were born,

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.670
just to know

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.240
what happened in the world that day.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.200
Those are people with roots.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.600
I envy them.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.030

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.790
I don't want any regret.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.000
I can't stop you anymore.

No matter what,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.550
you have to come home
every day to eat with me

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.030
I'm willing to use my not so broad,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.390
yet utterly stubborn back

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.670
to shield you from all surging noise

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.600
and scorching flame.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.000
Miss.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.720
Sing with all your heart

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.270
and smile as wildly as you wish.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.690
You don't need to come closer

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.000
to listen carefully.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.150
If you can sing freely,

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.960
behind you,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.200
my eyes

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.590
will follow you like a shadow.

(Hello.)

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.000
(Miss.)

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.960
(I have no right to judge,)

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.510
(but I believe you)

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.510
(have the right to make your names)

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.590
(gilded headlines every proud morning.)

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.640
(Wake up.)

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.270
(Let the night tear the numbers apart.)

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.640
(Set off.)

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.350
(Let the dawn light the road ahead.)

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.160
What are you all dawdling around for?

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.750
Let's start.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.350
(Hello.)

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.480
(The silent gale.)

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.590
(That falling leaf)

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.030
(was your final dance,)

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.000
(telling them)

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.350
(that the soil is preparing for spring.)

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.550
(Hello.)

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.160
(Yesterday,)

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.200
(I buried the words "utterly powerless")

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.440
(deep in my chest.)

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.590
(Hello, future.)

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.160
(Welcome)

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.200
(I'll inscribe "Fearless")

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.440
(in lead)

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.880
(and mail them to the vast dawn.)

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.110
The reconstructed image
of your biological mother's skull is ready,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.510
but we still can't confirm her identity.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.310
Next, we may need your assistance
in the investigation.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.360
So I'm considered as a witness now?

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.400
I can help you,

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.240
right?

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.350
Things are getting
more and more complicated.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.510
Your knowing Wu Feifei

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.680
can't be a coincidence.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.960
Based on our observation,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.790
Wu Feifei may leave the country soon.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.350
I hope you can find a way
to keep her here.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:11.640
Okay. I'll try.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:13.920
Also,

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.510
I really do have a lead here

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.550
that might help you.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.790
Do you remember

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.200
that I told you

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.880
that a song kept playing in my head?

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.640
That song

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.110
kept appearing in my childhood dreams.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.880
Later, I found it.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.240
It's this song.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.720
I hope it can help you.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.090
♪I give long roads
to the distant horizon♪

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.890
♪I give roses to love♪

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.970
♪What can I give you♪

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.490
♪My lover?♪

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.310
You don't have a straight.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.270
You're one card short.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.270
You need the big cat.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:07.680
Again.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.550
Mr. Ming, Mr. Cao.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.640
How about we stop for now?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.920
I want to talk to Dad.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.640
- Alright.
- Okay.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.910
If there's any legal issues
in Hong Kong, China, call me anytime.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.790
I lost anyway.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.440
Let's go.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.550
Something wrong?

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.720
Dad.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.030
You really had nothing
to do with that, right?

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.440
What are you talking about?

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.510
Mr. Xu's matters.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.590
Didn't I tell you already?

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.550
I had nothing to do with it.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.590
I just

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.030
might be leaving soon.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.240
I feel uneasy.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.160
Don't worry.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.400
I'm here at home.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.750
Don't worry about Yang.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.270
I'll take care of him.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.270
And your friend, Gao Feng.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.790
By reason and by right,

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.720
we should compensate him.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.310
Then it's settled.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.310
Once I settled down,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.550
we'll set a time

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.920
to call every day.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.480
Whatever happens here,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.550
you tell me.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.400
I hope I can help you.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.110
We'll do as you say.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.960
We'll call every day.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.680
If anything happens, we talk right away.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.200
Alright?

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.830
Feifei.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.160
Did you call network repair?

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.200
What network repair?

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.070
Yes, I called for one.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.740
(Professional Network Repair)

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:04.920
Sorry.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.160
I broke the rules.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.310
We had an agreement.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.640
I remember it.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.030
No names.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.000
No reasons.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.030
No explanations.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.960
But I'm just curious

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.480
what a near-perfect-score family is like.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.920
I wanted to see.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.790
You're really rich.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.310
Get to the point.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.360
You've crossed the line.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.030
Long Yu told me.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.680
You also went to the bar
asking about me.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.220
(Muke Club, Not Open Yet)

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.270
You crossed the line too.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.720
I've been investigating

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.680
the woman who might know about my past.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.270
How did it lead back to you?

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.640
Why are you involved too?

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.520
Is it really just a coincidence?

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.270
What are you after?

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.400
How much do you know?

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.000
I'm not obligated to tell you.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.070
My dad has told the police
everything he knows.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.830
When powerful people speak,

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.720
they leave three parts unsaid
and seven to interpretation.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.270
Can we really believe it all?

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.240
My dad is the head of the company.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.400
If he really knew something,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.950
he wouldn't have let your mother

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.160
lie in the plaza for over 20 years.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.110
I heard about your mother

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.960
and felt heartbroken.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.070
That's why Penglai Group

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.270
will compensate you properly.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.830
What about you?

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200
Don't you want the truth?

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.590
Is it him?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.480
Yes.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.130
Let me propose something.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.350
We work together
and get to the bottom of this.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.490
Just the two of us.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.980
You and I are just online friends.
Why should I work with you?

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.830
Then why did you call me
when you hesitated

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.750
about getting married?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.110
(Bestie)
I'm getting married.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.640
Should I go through with it?

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.510
I told you I flipped a coin.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.790
I could've called anyone.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.350
There's nothing left for us to discuss. You should go.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.160
Do you remember what you told me
in front of the statue?

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.110
You said you just ran away from home

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.380
and needed some space of your own.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.400
The reason we even met

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.440
is because neither of us

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.390
knew who we really were.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.680
Now I almost do.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:49.640
What about you?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.310
Bestie.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.070
Without this mansion and the identity
of the Wu family's heiress,

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.400
do you know who you are?

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.310
Let's work together
to find out the truth.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.480
Just the two of us.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.000
Look into this man.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.200
Okay.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.260
(Bestie: Have you decided?
If so, let's meet.)

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.110
Dad.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.240
Well?

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.750
How did it go this morning,

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.030
talking to your friend?

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.880
Nothing wrong with him

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.400
asking about his mom.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.160
Anyone

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.750
would keep digging
until they get to the bottom of things,

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.070
but he picked the wrong person.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.960
He should've come to me.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.590
Feifei, you're not a child anymore.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.240
Whether to go or stay

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.640
or help your friend investigate

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.350
is up to you.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.960
Someone's waiting for you at the bar.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.270
Tell Wu Feifei

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.160
I'm on my way.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.550
It's not her.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.940
(Muke Club)

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.160
Mr. Wu, it's our first time meeting.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.960
You're busy too.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.070
Just say what you need to say.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.510
Feifei mentioned

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.070
you like to go out,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.160
traveling, outdoor activities,

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.550
mountain climbing, and rock climbing.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.480
Here's

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.590
a private membership card
for a top local club.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.400
The annual fee is all paid.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.110
You don't need to work anymore.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.270
Go wherever you want to go.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.790
It's our first meeting.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.160
Consider it a gift.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.160
You're so generous.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.240
Do you have instructions for me?

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.440
Gao.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.400
However you handle your mother's case

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.590
is your business.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.440
Don't involve my daughter.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.880
Then did you explain

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.500
everything about my mother's case
to the police?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.880
I'll fully cooperate
with the investigation

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.510
to uncover the truth.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.000
As the head of Penglai,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.350
my burdens are heavy.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.590
If we don't investigate thoroughly,

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.160
it could affect stock prices

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.240
and many people's livelihoods.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.350
The responsibility on you is huge.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.350
But to be honest,

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.830
I'm just an unemployed person.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.400
I don't care
about businesses and companies.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.350
Gao.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.400
Given what happened to your mother,

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.830
it's understandable

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.830
you'd keep digging.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.440
I also want to help you.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.720
I want to talk to Wu Feifei.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.480
I came today

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.680
to ask for your help.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.350
Don't involve Feifei.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.830
Is that what she wants?

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.550
Yes.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.270
It's what she wants.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.000
She doesn't want to see you.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.070
What you say

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.550
sounds like you have
your daughter's best interests.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.550
But to an outsider like me,

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.310
isn't it blackmailing with family ties?

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.000
You wouldn't understand family ties.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.680
I just want Feifei

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.070
to live simply

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.440
and happily.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.680
The police will fully look
into your mother's case.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.400
If anyone is to be held accountable,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.960
it will naturally point to me.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.200
As the head of the company,

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.160
this is unavoidable.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.270
We might even meet in court.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.440
By the way,

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.830
do you have any requests?

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.270
Just tell me.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.110
No rush.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.550
Take your time.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.200
I'll go now.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.400
Mr. Wu.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.590
Have you considered

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.440
the point

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.110
of investigating something

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.160
from so long ago?

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.790
You're young.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.270
Life moves forward.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.790
Think about it again.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.480
Think it through.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:28.790
Hello everyone.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.270
I'm your Kun.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.830
Here's the latest news.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.880
(Penglai Group Press Conference)
Penglai Group's official WeChat says

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.110
Chairman Wu Guohao

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.000
will make a statement

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.160
regarding the recent Penglai Plaza

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.000
car accident.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.960
Let's see if what Mr. Wu says

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.160
will have any effect.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.960
Director.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.110
You've all worked hard.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.200
Come, have breakfast.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.340
Director.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.070
You've all been up all night, right?

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.830
No energy left, right?

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.070
When I first started working,

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.550
I could stay up late too.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.830
Back then,

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.640
we didn't have these resources.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.240
No computers, no internet.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.160
Checking cases and gathering info,

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.750
all relied on our two feet.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:12.750
It was exhausting.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.680
The conditions are
so much better than back then.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.480
Software, hardware,
and all kinds of high-tech stuff.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.680
Everything's available.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.960
But don't forget,

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.070
our opponents are cunning.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.070
So don't be discouraged.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.510
Anything within human ability

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.510
isn't difficult.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.270
I'll give you the highest access rights

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.510
and coordinate

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.070
with relevant city departments.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.720
We'll investigate Penglai Group's

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.070
business, taxes, construction safety,

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.830
and so on.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.750
Leave no trace unchecked.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.750
We must find

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.590
Madam He.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.590
I believe

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.200
we'll make a breakthrough.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.920
Based on surveillance footage checks,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.590
we've located the suspected fugitive,
the café waitress,

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.470
who recently
appeared near the ferry terminal.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.550
She may be fleeing.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.220
Execute immediate arrest.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.070
Yes.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.200
Stop running. You can't escape.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.030
Do you want to struggle
and I handcuff you

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.390
or you want to walk down voluntarily?

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.790
These are two different situations.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.720
Li Churan.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.400
Sophomore at Binchuan
University of Finance and Economics.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.390
Excellent academic performance
during school

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.750
For several consecutive semesters,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.980
she received the "Three Good Student"
title and scholarship.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.480
With such a bright future,

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.830
why help Madam He?

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.030
What's your relationship with her?

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.960
I told you.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.750
She'll come tomorrow at 5:00 PM.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.070
Don't you want to save her?

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.640
A woman unrelated to you

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.270
sponsored an orphan
to study for so many years,

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.750
raising her into a university student.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.320
You're the orphan, right?

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.840
These days
we've been looking for Madam He.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.760
Even with today's advanced technology,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.070
we still haven't found

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.030
her whereabouts.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.190
Why?

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.280
I know Madam He is in poor health

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.400
and has mobility issues.

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.030
Have you wondered
without you by her side

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.360
these past days,

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.710
- she might be...
- You're talking nonsense!

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.630
You know best
whether I'm talking nonsense.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.030
One person

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:34.440
risking their life

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.480
to protect someone unrelated

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.030
is very difficult.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.760
You're compassionate and loyal,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.960
but you're wrong.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.110
Every minute you delay

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.800
could put another life

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.440
at risk,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.630
including Madam He's.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.670
The bones in the statue
have been there for years.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.400
Why is it only discovered

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.150
now?

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.400
Those who planned the car crash

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.510
chose this method to send a message.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.400
Could it be because they also believe

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.190
it's time for the truth to come out?

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.280
She chose this way to speak

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.510
because she believes

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.550
we will investigate to the end.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.630
Li Churan.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.670
We need to know

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.190
what Madam He wants to do

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:13.960
only can we help her

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.710
and save her.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.440
We still have a chance.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.320
Let me in.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.070
Let me in. Don't block my way.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:03.670
Let me in. Let go!

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.440
Calm down.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.070
Let me in.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.480
Let me in.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.550
Don't block her way.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.110
This is for you.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.800
Li Churan.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.630
You're a kind child
with a sense of justice.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:45.920
When I told you this address,

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.440
I already figured out

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.670
you would eventually
bring the police here.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.880
You're still young.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.510
I'm sorry for dragging you

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.030
into my affairs.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.710
That's enough.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.630
Don't come here again.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.230
Today I want to tell you

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.440
that since we met,

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.070
all the acts you've been grateful for

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.110
were only for myself.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.280
I needed some help from you,

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.480
so I did you favors.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.550
I guided you step by step to today.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.280
You were just eager

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.190
to show gratitude to me.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.110
As for what I have to do

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.150
or where I'm going,

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.230
you don't need to know.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.480
Goodbye.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.940
(The exiled universe echoes,)

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.060
(leaving a trace in the flesh of time.)

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.500
(A hidden wound awakens repeatedly.)

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.190
I'll be leaving soon.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.510
Why did you ask me here?

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.320
The two of us have known each other
for two years.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.230
Regarding family,

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.400
I always try to find it,
yet you always try to escape.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.440
We're not from the same world.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.190
Maybe some impulses are the same.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.990
That's why
we can still talk and get along.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.760
Sometimes people have to make
unavoidable choices.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.610
You can't always act for yourself.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.840
I was sincere in advising you.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.920
When were you not sincere?

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.110
I've been thinking these past few days.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:59.150
My mom died in that statue.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.190
I've lived all alone

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.110
and survived until today.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.360
Why?

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.070
I've told Su Min a few times

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.480
about my dreams.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.230
Maybe my dreams

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.710
could connect to clues about my mother.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.030
Isn't it just a dream?

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.230
I also dreamed of my mom.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.920
Did you also dream she sang to you?

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.710
I also dreamed of a house.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.880
It was vague and blurry.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.880
I don't know if I remember it

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.440
or if it was just a broken dream.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.550
Your father asked me a question before.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.190
Have you considered

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.760
the point of investigating something

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.920
from so long ago?

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.360
Tell him for me.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.840
Sometimes people should look forward.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.760
But for someone like me,

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.070
I think being an echo chamber
is more interesting.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.510
Some voices have been buried for years.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.960
Hitting my broken wall

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.190
should make an echo.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.880
I won't let go of my mother's case.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.710
No matter where you go,

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:36.480
what drinks we shared,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.500
or what we talked about,

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.400
I will investigate everything.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.590
If I offended your father in any way,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.710
I apologize.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.920
Staying or leaving

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.590
is up to you.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.440
Wu.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.700
What's the situation?

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.060
