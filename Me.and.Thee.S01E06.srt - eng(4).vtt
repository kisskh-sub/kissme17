No one has the right to mess
with the one I call mine.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.900
I just realized how good
being taken care of by someone feels.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.600
Your sister asked if you had a partner.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.770
Is it true that you don’t have anyone?

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.180
Where would I find the time
to catch feelings for anyone?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.260
I’m only spending time with you
these days.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.590
Kian!

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.930
If you miss her, just fly to see her.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.300
Hong Kong is only a short flight away.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.330
Mok.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.550
I need your help with something.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.650
HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS PEACEFUL REST.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.840
Shit!

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.420
Mr. Thee!

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.540
May I take liberties with you?

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.900
(You have my body.)

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.920
(But you’ll never have my heart.)

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.500
No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.200
We’re not there yet.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.070
(You took advantage of me!)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.900
(You wanted me so desperately,
didn’t you?)

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.020
(I just indulged you, that’s all.)

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.900
(I hate you!)

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.970
I didn’t take advantage of him.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.640
In that case,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.670
may I take liberties with you?

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.100

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.800
SOS, Lookplub.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.770
(This is the only thing)

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.800
(that might help me forget
your terrible actions, even just a little.)

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.100
What is it?

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.500
Take this.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.100
You might want to splash it on my face.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.740
This soap opera is nothing like
you’ve seen before.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.800
What do you mean?

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.820
Wanna take a walk along the beach?

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.950
Can we go anywhere but that place, please?

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.000
Don’t you always spoil me?

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.100
I just want to celebrate my birthday
at the beach.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.700
You’ve taken me there in past years.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.100
Why is it a problem this year?

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.900
Could you not be demanding, please?

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.670
You know I don’t like that word.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.200
Why do you still say it?

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.600
It’s just for today.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.900
Can’t I have that?

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.610
Okay.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.770
Take me wherever you want.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.400
I never get to choose anything
in my life anyway.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.300
I’ll take it from here.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.690
LEE 99, BANGKOK

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.290
Please get in.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.770
I’m sorry, Mr. Thee.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.210
Aren’t you afraid
your clothes will get dirty?

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.370
I can just wash them, right?

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.570
Come on.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.700
Are you sure you don’t want to
splash water on my face?

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.430
What do you want to do, then?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.800
Why would I want to do anything to you?

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.000
I rushed into intimacy too soon.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.070
I couldn't control myself.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.770
If I could turn back time,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.260
I wouldn’t have done
something so thoughtless.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.670
What you did…

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.600
No.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.650
What we did…

00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:01.200
You think that was thoughtless?

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.070
I’m just afraid

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.400
I might’ve accidentally
hurt your feelings.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.800
I’m not hurt.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.300
I’m just surprised.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.800
Surprised?

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.299
I should’ve pushed you away
when you moved your face close to mine,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.799
instead of letting you kiss me.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.500
Just being friends with you

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.320
already feels like something
out of my reach, but now we—

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.200
If anyone should feel like
this relationship is out of reach,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.600
it should be me.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.980
The Master wants to see you, sir.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.950
You might want to fix your clothes first.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.930
Not yet.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.420
I’m breaking the rule

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.050
by letting my heart overrule my head.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.050
I know this is not easy.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.440
Our worlds…

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.230
They’re separate.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.970
This is the end, isn’t it?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.000
Well…

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.160
What would you say if I told you…

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.900
I’ve accidentally caught feelings
for someone?

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.700
(Who? What? Where? How?)

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.300
(Has someone been pursuing you?)

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.400
(So this trip is actually a date?)

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.200
(How naughty.)

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.700
You’re reading way too much into this.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.300
Calm down, Lookplub.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.600
I’m actually confused.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.600
Really confused.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.500
(Tell me the truth.)

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.100
(How far have you two gotten?)

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.600
Well…

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.870
We already kissed.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.400
(How do you feel?)

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.700
(Do you want to kiss this person again?)

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:19.730
Plub!

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.200
What are you talking about?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.750
(That’s a serious question.
I’m not teasing you.)

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.650
(I’m helping you figure it out.)

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.700
How?

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.900
(If it was just a kiss, then it’s goodbye.)

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.900
(But if it left you wanting more,
you can move forward.)

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.070
Well…

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.600
I don’t know.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.300
But from what others told me,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.970
this person seems like someone
I wouldn’t like at all.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.730
We have nothing in common.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.350
We’re different in almost everything.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.650
(Learning from others’ work)

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.500
(can never be as good as seeing through
your own lens, Mr. Photographer.)

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.930
Don’t rush to the ending just yet.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.100
I…

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.100
I want to keep watching a little longer.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.070
I’m handing you the remote to turn it off,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.100

Sorry for showing up so suddenly.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.260
If the villa is not ready yet,
I can wait in the lobby.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.320
The villa has been ready
since this morning.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.450
We’ve been hosting—

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.100
Mr. Rome.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.100
Oh, I’m sorry.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.600
The wind was blowing, and I was afraid
sand might get in your eyes.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.910
Uh…

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.600
If the villa is hosting another guest,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.730
could you prepare a room
on the yacht instead?

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.600
The villa is hosting Mr. Theerakit.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.650
Kian is here?

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:28.970
What’s he doing here?

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.470
Did he come alone?

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.640
Mr. Theerakit’s guest is staying
in the luxury sea view room.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.650
Let me bring your luggage to your room.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.150
Oh.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.870
So this is why
you didn’t want to bring me here.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.500
Please don’t tease Mr. Thee.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.700
You know I’m not mean.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.100
Ugh, I’m so tired.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.600
I feel so much older.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.650
Do you want to take a bath?

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.000
I’ve asked them to prepare
a big seafood meal for us.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.100
What time is it now?

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.200
The sun is probably setting soon.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.700
You want to watch the sunset?

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.600
I know a very beautiful spot.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.660
Shall we go now?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:42.970
Where is it?

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.460
The Grand Canyon in Arizona.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.360
Or we could just go to
Mount Fuji in Japan,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.840
but we probably wouldn’t make it
in time for sunset.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.440
ARSENI has a hotel there,
in case you’re interested.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.000
It’s not about the place.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.470
It’s about who’s next to you.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.800
You’re right.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:21.700
The view beside me right now is more
beautiful than any sunset in the world.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.170
It really is more beautiful.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.750
What are you thinking?

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.000
I’m thinking…

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.700
I want to kiss you again.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.370
But I want this to be a kiss
you’re willing to allow.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.760
One you have no more doubts about.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.530
Oh, shit!

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.660
I didn’t see anything.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.050
Relax. I just thought the light
was pretty.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.150
I swear.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.850
I’m Rome.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.700
Kian’s younger brother.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.350
I’m Peach.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.200
You’re…?

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.240
Well…

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.500
You getting this flustered is
a good answer.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.100
I’m sorry for being a bit rude earlier.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.030
I was just going to take photos
of the views,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.800
but I ended up taking candids
of my brother.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.300
I’ve deleted all of them, though.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.900
Trust me.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.410
By the way, I've already had them
move your stuff here, Peach.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.700
I’m so glad we have so many people
for the party tonight.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.400
Have you asked Peach if he can make it?

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.020
Oh, am I being rude again?

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:52.940
No!

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.350
It’s alright.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.450
I don’t have plans this evening.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.200
Okay.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.440
Your room is in the back, Mr. Peach.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.500
That room has the best views.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:06.950
It’s yours, Peach.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.900
Well…please excuse me.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.500
Of course.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.550
I’ll go help him.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:30.600
No need!

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.600
You had one job,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.700
but you still fell short.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.000
What a mean boss.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.900
If it were me, I’d quit.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.700
I’m not quitting.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.850
Since he’s protecting you so much,

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.700
you should ask him for a bonus instead.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.700
Oh.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:01.800
How stingy!

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.950
You don’t have to put up with
someone like him.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.290
Come work with me instead.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.610
I’ll triple your salary.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.900
No, thank you.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.400
Is my brother bothering you?

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.100
You came here to rest,

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:31.850
but things ended up getting chaotic.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.050
It’s okay.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.650
Your brother is adorable.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.660
Are you complimenting another man
in front of me?

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.900
I mean, your brother is friendly.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.700
What a relief.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.170
My heart almost shattered.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.850
Don’t be dramatic.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.200
Enjoy your rest.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.670
I’ll come get you when dinner’s ready.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.460
No need.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.100
After I take a shower, I’ll come down.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:17.970
Cute.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.200
Hurry up,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.900
before I start missing you.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.750
Did I make the right decision or not?

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.060
Why are you here?

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.450
You should be asking how I got here,

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:54.850
not why I’m here.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.900
Your Thai is still as lousy as ever.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:02.900
I’m asking the right question.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.300
Why are you here?

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.500
Do you think you’re the only one
getting interrupted?

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.100
I always come here
to celebrate my birthday with Mok.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.140
You’re the one interrupting me.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.200
I don’t want Mom and Dad
to know about this.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.270
Sure.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.300
We’re a team, bro.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.300
This is his birthday gift.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.670
I’m sorry, Mr. Mok. What did you say?

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.400
A normal life without bodyguards.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.550
No escort vehicles.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.800
It’s the birthday gift
Mr. Krit wants the most.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.630
Mr. Krit?

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:04.700
It’s Mr. Rome.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.380
Is it Mr. Rome’s birthday today?

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.000
Yes.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.270
Oh, then we must find a cake.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.500
Has anyone prepared it yet?

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:19.380
If not, could we trouble the staff
to prepare one for him?

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.450
Mr. Thee and Mr. Krit
are not allowed to celebrate.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.800
It’s a rule.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.190
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.220
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:40.910
Mr. Thee!

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.300
Since that incident, the Lee family
has never held any parties again.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.470
Master said that when we gather,

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.700
we become a fixed target for our enemies.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.900
Mr. Thee was sent to Bangkok

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.800
partly because Master wanted
to diversify the risk.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.250
If one day, something were to happen
in Hong Kong,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:12.850
ARSENI wouldn’t fall,

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.600
because Mr. Thee is here.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.500
Why does Mr. Rome get to live
with his family in Hong Kong?

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.020
No.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.700
Mr. Krit is just waiting for his time.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.100
Once he’s ready, he has to move far away.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.800
Maybe to the other side of the world.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.200
Maybe even further than here.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.270
Their lives

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.900
aren’t as glamorous as
everyone thinks, are they?

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.130
Hey!

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.900
You two over there!

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.000
Seafood is almost done.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.890
This is what you called “cooked”?

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.150
Please have a seat, you two.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.060
And you said, “Trust me.”

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.660
Let’s redo the whole thing.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.170
Yes.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.370
Let’s start over.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.770
We could’ve had the kitchen handle it.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.510
All this trouble,
just to have it your way.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.200
Come on! It’s my special day.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.100
Did you forget?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.190
I just wanted to have fun.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.500
Let’s eat while it’s hot.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.450
Oh.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.200
I forgot.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.180
I saw you left this at home.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.570
If Dad hears about this,
you’ll be in trouble.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:03.160
Peach.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.740
Peach.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.870
Peach.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:10.700
Peach.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.610
Peach.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.300
Someone just called you.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.400
Oh.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.500
I’ll be right back.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.600
Lock up the house properly tonight.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.200
Don’t forget to lock the windows too.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.500
I’ll be back tomorrow.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.700
Hmm?

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.250
Ka.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.900
Good night na ka.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.000
Is everything alright, Mr. Rome?

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.300
They say a man who says “ka” is romantic.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.400
Are you romantic, Peach?

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.170
I only use it with my sister.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.100
You’re warmhearted, you know?

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.750
Happy birthday, Mr. Rome.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.000
I wish you lots of happiness this year.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.570
Also, I know it’s hard,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.600
but I hope you get to live
the life you want.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.700
Did Mok tell you my story?

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.250
He’s so good at talking to everyone,

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.300
except me.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.400
You only get one day a year

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.000
to do whatever you want.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.800
Why did you choose to come here?

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:23.010
I guess because this is
where I can live my most normal life.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.270
Normal?

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.400
I really can’t imagine
what real life is like for you two.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.000
Can I ask you another question?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.970
You said the other thing
Mr. Thee can’t buy is love?

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.900
We’re all forbidden to love.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.000
So he’s not only standing in the way of
his own happiness, but someone else’s too.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.570
Don’t listen to him too much.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.330
But what Mr. Mok said is true, isn’t it?

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:17.500
Yes.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.600
It’s true.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.000
But Kian has always been
trying to change those rules.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.650
Can you be there to encourage him?

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.350
Me?

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.650
Can you stay to guide him and
give him the confidence

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:54.670
that he’s doing the right thing?

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.050
Peach hasn’t finished his call?

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.230
He has, but he wanted to take a walk.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.060
What did you talk to Peach about?

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.670
Everything about you.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.500
Everything?

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.900
This one is good.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.650
You chose well.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:49.370
Are you already boyfriends?

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:52.900
Not yet.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:56.100
Not yet?

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.200
I haven’t officially asked him.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.600
I haven’t ordered a ring, either,

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.800
or prepared dowry, engagement gold,
or a marital home.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.900
Everything takes time.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.700
I’m not spontaneous or demanding
like you always are.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.300
You’re asking him to be your boyfriend,
not to marry you.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:37.270
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.020
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.300
Make a wish.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.300
Come on. Make a wish.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.130
This is so cute, Peach.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.730
Do you want to take some photos?

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:32.140
Sure.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:44.600
Come on.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.000
One, two, three.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.570
Mr. Mok.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:55.380
Please get in the photo.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.580
One more.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.800
One, two, three.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.550
You’re breaking the rule, Mr. Peach.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.670
But I saw you smiling with them.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.400
I want a team, if you’re interested.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:28.739
Why are you stealing mine?

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.659
Take that one.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:30.670
Just take that one, Kian!

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.219
I want to eat chocolate!

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.409
Peach gave that to me!

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.590
That one is more beautiful!

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:39.429
Cheers!

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.590
Yay!

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.449
Drink up.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.730
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:49.940
Let’s refill your glass!

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.580
What kind of brother are you?

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:56.980
Join us!

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.580
♪ In the world ♪

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.200
Fun time’s over.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.110
Let’s hang out again
when we have time, Peach.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:22.000
Thank you for the birthday party
and for the first cake in my life.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:24.740
See you next time.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:29.650
Wait, Mok.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.950
Yes?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.300
I’ll leave this with you.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.370
Only use it when necessary.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.600
Yes.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.500
Actually, if it’s necessary,
you can carry it.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:56.250
I’ll get used to it.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.750
I’m just the owner of a perfume company,

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.970
not a police officer.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.600
I don’t need to carry that thing
all the time, do I?

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.350
Is that really all you are?

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.170
I’m not carrying a gun right now.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.500
If something happens to me,

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.500
you have to protect me.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.700
Your muscles are as big as my head,

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.500
and you want me to protect you?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.650
THEE 9, BANGKOK

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.300
So how’s that for refusing to fly back?

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.550
Can’t say I didn’t warn you.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.700
Well, Rome suggested I do this.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.100
He said it’d buy me more time
with the person next to me.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.200
Who would’ve known

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.340
you’d sleep the whole way here?

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.570
Take a warm bath when you get home,
so you don’t get back pain.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.830
Do you have a tub at home?

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:17.800
No.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:20.000
Then I’ll have one installed right now.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.130
Stop.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.000
Plub is home today.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.900
I can’t let you in the house.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.300
You’re dating Theerakit Kian Lee.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.100
Isn’t that something to show off
to the whole town?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.270
We’re not boyfriends yet.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.700
Don’t be presumptuous
or try anything sneaky.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.840
You’re so mean.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.200
Your words hurt my feelings
time and again.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.470
You should go.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:54.060
See you at ARSENI tomorrow.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.500
You’re going to the office tomorrow?

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.800
I’ll come pick you up.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.530
No.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.800
Don’t send people to pick me up.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.050
Don’t prepare breakfast.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.000
I’ll just see you at the office.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.600
I completely forgot.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.270
Now that I know
I’ll see you at the office tomorrow,

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.500
I want to go to bed already.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.600
Good night in advance.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.100
If you say so. Good night.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:37.670
Oh.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:38.900
One more thing.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.400
Get ready.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.500
Starting tomorrow,
I’m going full force in chasing you.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.900
How’s it going, Mr. Lovestruck?

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:05.800
Who’s that?

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.500
Tell your sister.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.400
Please.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.620
Tell me.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:13.730
I promise I won’t tease you.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.050
And I won’t tell anyone either.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.000
When I’m ready,
you’ll be the first to know.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:36.690
Well, I thought you said you were
taking a break from matters of the heart.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:41.600
Who’s the girl who snapped you out
of your hibernation?

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.250
Tell me.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.500
Please.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.900
Well…

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.390
It’s not a girl.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.800
Are you into men?

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.700
Since when? I had no idea.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:54.700
Actually, this is the first man
I’ve ever had feelings for.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:00.830
Are you mad at me?

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.400
I’m sorry.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.200
Why would I be mad at you?

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.610
I’m just a little surprised.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:42.500
That person must be amazing

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.500
and take really good care of you,
right, Lookpeach?

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.700
Why do you think that?

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.500
Because when you talk about him,

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:00.980
you turn into this tiny thing.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.800
Are you okay with who I am?

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.550
Of course.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.020
I don’t have any problem with it at all.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.750
As long as he’s a good guy

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.200
who can take care of you.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:53.900
Thank you.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.400
I hope this love brings you
nothing but happiness.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:13.850
And I hope that person
takes care of you properly.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.270
Just half of what I can do is enough.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.100
Who takes care of whom these days?

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.000
I take care of you, of course.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.310
Let’s go.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.330
If we don’t hurry,
you’ll miss your flight.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:47.200
I won’t let you see me off.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.450
Go back inside the house.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.380
But Mr. Thee told me to—

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.300
This is my order.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.250
Once I’m allowed to love,

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.130
I’ll hurry back to love you.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.000
Safe travels.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.250
Once I’m allowed to love,

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:56.900
I’ll hurry back to love you.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:12.600
When will you finally admit how you feel?

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.510
They said Mr. Kritdanai
has arrived home safely.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.420
Do you want to take a few more days off?

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:45.650
It’s alright.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:47.570
This is more than enough for me.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.730
If there’s nothing else, please excuse me.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.230
Oh, before you go,
turn off the lights for me.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:04.970
I’m going to sleep now.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:14.380
But it’s only…

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.250
(Good night.)

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.810
(I hope we meet again in our dreams.)

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.200
(But if another man shows up
in your slumber,)

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.300
(wake up immediately. I’m possessive.)

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.200
Peach, I need to scan my fingers now,
or I’ll be late.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.150
I have to go.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.010
Do your best at work.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.160
Hey.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.980
Here’s a bouquet of flowers from
every continent where plants can grow.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.090
It really suits you.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.400
My whole world.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.800
Thank you.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.100
Do you like it?

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.100
Yes.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.500
I mean the person in front of you.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.800
Do you like him?

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.010
Mr. Mork, good to see you.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.550
I didn’t know you’d be at the beach too.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:35.900
I already got you some souvenirs.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:38.100
Thank you.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:40.350
Here you go.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.540
You can snack on it while working.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:48.430
I’m going in.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.400
Do your best at work.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.730
Boss.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.060
I thought you didn’t like
anything spicy or squid.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.240
No bonus for you this year.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:11.600
Is there even any left to take away?

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.000
If there’s none left,
I’ll dock your salary.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.100
Hey, Nuch.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:23.800
Hi.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.130
Oh, there you are!

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.000
My extraordinary photographer.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.400
I’ve missed you so much.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:31.660
I got you some souvenirs.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.200
Oh!

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.700
Hey, everyone.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.220
There are mild ones and extra spicy ones.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.000
Pick whichever you like.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.300
ARSENI without you is like
an elephant without a trunk, Peach.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:46.700
Can I have two?

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:47.420
Oh?

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:50.900
I’m good now.

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:53.550
I’m just here to help with your work.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:54.700
I’m not getting paid.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.650
Don’t get rid of anyone.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.800
Oh, you’re too kind.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:00.900
You’re so kind.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:04.900
Hi, Peach.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.400
I’m Trend.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:32.800
Would you like to eat something else?

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.800
I’ll ask the maid to replace it.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.600
Get me the three-flavored dried squid.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.620
But you don’t eat—

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.900
It’s my business whether I eat it or not!

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.070
I want it.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.250
You should tell Mr. Peach directly

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.600
that you’re mad
about not getting a souvenir.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:53.430
I can’t be unreasonable or silly.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.850
What if Peach gets annoyed with me?

00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.200
You’re good at everything,

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:00.200
except love.

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:10.180
Are you caring about someone else’s
feelings more than your own?

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.800
You’re lucky I’m not ordering you to slap
your mouth as many times as your age!

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.700
Don’t ever let me hear you call Peach
“someone else” again.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:21.950
I’m sorry.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:24.700
He’s not someone else.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.100
He’s a special someone.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:36.800
You can leave.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:40.200
I have to work hard
like Peach told me to.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:41.530
Yes, sir.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.500
The company got me a new camera.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.600
Wow, this is a good one.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.110
No matter how good it is,
I still take bad photos.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.100
I’m slowing everyone down.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:25.970
I know the whole story now.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.010
I’m sorry for being the reason
you got removed from the project.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:32.800
It’s alright.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.300
You don’t need to apologize.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:35.780
It’s Wiwid’s fault.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:41.500
He just saw you as a pawn.

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:42.670
Don’t think too much about it.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.780
I was so scared of you at first,

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.850
but Plub said you’re kind.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:57.400
I didn’t think
you’d be this kind and cute.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:06.850
You can talk to me about anything…

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:08.620
work-related.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.930
TWISTKO

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:23.500
Peach!

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.180
-Oh!
-Hey!

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.600
Your outfit’s all crinkled now!

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:32.100
I’ve missed you so much!

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.210
Yeah, get down first.

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.770
Mind my back.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:34.880
Okay.

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:38.220
Are you the photographer today?

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:40.220
No, I’m just helping out.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:43.100
Oh.

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.600
How many hours of OT
should we expect today?

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.340
Don’t tease him.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.380
Give him a chance.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.200
I’m here to help.

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.570
I’m just kidding.

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:57.600
That looks good.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.730
No, you have to hold
the product, don’t you?

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:03.600
You can’t get your hands messy.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.680
Here.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:10.800
Mmm.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.430
It’s so good.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.330
Can I have more?

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:14.910
Here.

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:21.020
Mr. Peach would be so happy

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.000
if he knew you were
working this hard, Boss.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.370
Shameless!

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:27.970
How dare they do that
with the lights and cameras around?

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.600
(I’m going to get coffee.)

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.800
(Do you want anything?)

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.100
Get me any coffee,

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:54.380
but if they have you in a cup on the menu,
buy out their whole stock.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.300
Let’s hurry.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.500
I have to be a good boy
and wait for my coffee in my room.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:26.130
Puppy love when you’re old is kinda scary.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:29.400
Here’s your order.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.650
Hello.

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.100
(Peach.)

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:44.210
(What’s with the cold greeting?)

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:48.500
Well, I didn’t expect you to call me.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.550
If I told you I missed you,
would you believe me?

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.400
When the sun rises in the west,
I’ll think about it.

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:01.100
I have a favor to ask.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:06.200
My boss really loves your work
and wants to collaborate with you.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.500
But he hasn’t been able to reach you.

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.400
So I…

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:15.300
So you’re using your connection
as my ex to get me hired.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.050
Guilty as charged.

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:38.500
So sweet.

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:39.970
Huh?

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.700
But I ordered it unsweetened.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.150
It’s probably because
you were carrying it.

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.100
Oh, get a grip.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.770
Things are going well downstairs.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.300
Trend is not bad. He’s just very new.

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:02.200
Do you want to go for dinner
and a movie tonight?

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:04.300
Why?

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.660
Isn’t that what people do
when they’re getting to know each other?

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:11.400
If you want to get to know me,
why not take it more seriously?

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:15.350
Sure.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.550
I’ll learn with you.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:27.500
I already have plans this evening.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.430
It’s another hobby I love.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:30.300
I’m coming with you.

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:33.570
It’s pretty quiet and boring, though.

00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:39.950
Just breathing and doing nothing with you

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:42.900
is interesting enough.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:47.500
Excuse me.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.940
You have an urgent meeting
with the Hong Kong team.

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.480
But I’m leaving with Peach.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.340
I’ll go ahead.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.770
You can stay, finish your work,
and catch up with me later.

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:01.800
I’ll send you the location.

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:07.200
See you later.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.800
(Learning from others’ work)

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.050
(can never be as good as seeing through
your own lens, Mr. Photographer.)

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:05.130
Hey! How old are you?

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:11.640
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:16.700
One, two, three.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.670
I get it now, Lookplub.

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.200
Are you done with work?

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.980
You took so many photos of me in secret.

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.600
You’re just…

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.060
so madly in love.

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:55.000
No.

00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.000
It’s my mission to figure out the answer.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:01.300
Am I your answer?

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:10.500
The answer is your smile.

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:16.070
Because it made me realize

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.900
the wolf here

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.200
is fake.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.100
You’re actually just
a goofy golden retriever.

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:35.600
Dogs of that breed
really love their owners.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.100
When did you take that?

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.700
When the puppy knew for sure

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.100
who his owner was.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.370
Can I pick up where we left off?

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.500
A kiss you’d be willing to allow.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.300
No one’s going to interrupt us
this time, right?

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:08.690
No one can come in anymore.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.610
THE DARKROOM PURCHASE CONTRACT
HAS BEEN FINALIZED, MR. THEE.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.220
If it’s too much,
please don’t force yourself.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.500
You’re only going to suffer.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:10.100
No!

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:12.250
It’s Peach’s favorite.

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:14.000
I’ll learn to eat it!

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.560
You’re the only one who shows up
at my house this early in the morning.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:32.400
I’m the only one?

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.690
Peach!

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.590
Hey! Plub is here!

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.300
Lie down!

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.300
Here’s a souvenir for you.

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:40.770
This shows that, to Peach,
I’m not just anyone.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.100
I don’t think I can make it
to dinner with you anymore.

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:46.400
This is my real life.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.660
You’ve done really well getting this far.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.320
From now on,
I’ll take care of you and your sister.
