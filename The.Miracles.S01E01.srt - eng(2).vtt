00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:09.439
It's right across.

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:11.280
Thanks.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.959
This is the equipment area.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:33.400
Unauthorized personnel are not allowed.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:37.599
Hello.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:38.439
Excuse me,

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:40.359
Xinpeng Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.280
how do I get there?

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:42.599
Go out and take Elevator 3.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.359
Go up to the 20th floor first.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.120
Then go through the inside,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.840
the innermost corridor.

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:45.840
Then switch to another elevator.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.959
Thanks for your trouble.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:49.719
You're welcome.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.120
Hello, Xinpeng.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.000
Mom.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Have you set up the stall?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.840
I'm doing fine.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.040
Mom asked if you've set up the stall.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.240
I did, I did. There's lots of work.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.039
How are you?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.280
There's plenty of work.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.000
If anything happens, you must tell Mom.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.520
I know, I know.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.479
Mom.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.439
By the way,

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.680
you just retired, so rest well.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.560
Enjoy life.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.520
In a few days,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.039
when things slow down at my shop,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.759
I'll pick you up

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.240
to go on a road trip to Xinjiang.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.240
Gotta go, gotta go.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.080
Super busy.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.080
Need to repay 180,000 by the end of the month.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.360
(Happy Retirement)

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:17.199
Hello.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.919
I saw your

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:19.800
recruitment information.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.879
I can wait tables and cook.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.400
Why do you only hire

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.639
people under 40?

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.960
Do you know office software?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.120
I know you have a cousin

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.960
in Shenzhen.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.120
Health certificate.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400
Can you do deep searches?

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.199
Brother, once you see me,

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.879
you'll know.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.039
I look quite young.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.199
No wrinkles on my face.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.120
Then can you edit photos?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.599
Stop talking nonsense.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.039
We're not a good fit.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.560
No.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.120
No,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.120
at your age,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.000
coming to Shenzhen to make it...

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.840
You don't sound like a local either.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.520
I mean, at your age,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.919
just enjoy life at home

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.520
and let your children worry less.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.639
I just want to help my child worry less.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.719
Seg, Seg! Two yuan per order!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.960
Seg, Seg! Two yuan per order!

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.879
Anyone? Anyone?

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.280
Seg, Seg! Two yuan!

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.080
Two bucks, two bucks. Here.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.919
Alright, alright.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.040
What do these people do?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.399
Tower runners. You don't know?

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.120
How much can they make?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.519
Let me put it this way.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.800
Just one Seg Tower

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.199
has about 15,000 people.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.079
For one delivery order,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.040
a delivery driver makes about

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.879
six yuan.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.639
He's willing to spend two yuan

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.480
on these people

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800
to have them deliver the order upstairs.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.240
Add dinner to that,

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.040
that's 60,000 orders.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.160
That's not counting coffee,

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.240
fruit, late-night snacks, and so on.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.680
Really.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.279
Add it all together, per day,

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.600
it's a 100,000 yuan market.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.800
Brother,

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:43.759
help me print this out.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:44.319
Hurry up.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:45.199
No,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.040
you... this isn't suitable for you.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.160
Why can't I do it?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.120
No,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.399
this... this is too hard.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:52.160
Hard?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920
Then you have no idea

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.439
what I used to do.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.319
What did you do?

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:25.639
You take one.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.079
Thanks for your hard work, Lao Zhou.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.560
Lao Zhou.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.800
I earned a big order.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:35.879
This one is four yuan.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.839
Oh my

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.920
Thank you

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.439
My legs were shaking with fear

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.160
You're amazing, you really are

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.720
I would've lost this order without you

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.000
Thank you

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:58.000
You're so darn good

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.879
We've met before

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.759
By the garbage station

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.480
You gave me directions

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.879
Yes, yes, it's you, it's you

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.600
Hello

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.319
Enjoy your meal

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:04.160
Here, have a drink

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.160
Don't be polite

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.560
If you have something to say, go ahead

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.680
Let's get straight to the point

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.600
I watched you all noon

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.360
Working with great enthusiasm

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.360
How much can you earn?

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.399
It's just manual labor

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.920
More work, more pay. Less work, less pay

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.319
No upper limit

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.439
Leave it here

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.560
Your delivery. Enjoy your meal

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.759
Can you take me on?

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.399
It's not up to me

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.879
Alright then, come with me

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.759
I'll take you to find Sister Wang

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.639
You just wait there

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:29.560
She'll come find you

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.160
Sister Wang

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:38.480
Sister Wang

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.319
Sister Wang

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.199
Sis Li

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.439
This order is for the VIP Floors

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:43.360
That's right

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.279
Okay, thank you

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.759
Okay

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.879
So you're Sister Wang

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.879
This order is also for the VIP Floors

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.480
Yes

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.560
Thank you

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.120
Sister Wang

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.240
I want to do what you do

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.439
Go ahead and do it

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.279
I just need to earn some quick cash

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:01.560
Then earn it

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:03.560
Can I join you?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.240
No

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.639
Your line of work isn't that hard

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.720
Whether it's hard or not isn't for you to say

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.439
I'm afraid you'll ruin my reputation

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:17.879
Please swipe your card

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.639
Unauthorized entry. Please swipe your card

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.959
And ruin your reputation?

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.680
I am the reputation

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.560
Brother Zhou

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.720
Did you make this?

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.319
Do you want it?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.680
Is it expensive?

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.319
For tower runners, it's free

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.160
I want it

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:37.199
A true craftsman

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.079
If you don't earn money, what do you eat?

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.920
I run the towers myself too

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.759
So I don't take money from my own people

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.639
I earn money from outsiders

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:57.680
A principled man

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.800
Earns money the right way

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.279
You want to work on your own?

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:01.639
That Sister Wang of yours

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.040
I don't get along with her

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.759
Then give it a try

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.759
Look

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:07.120
By the way

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.000
Do you want the regular version

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.120
or the professional version?

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:12.759
I want the domestic one

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.720
When you pick up the delivery

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.639
what are you scribbling on paper?

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:21.759
It's not scribbling

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.319
It's mathematics

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.240
My physical strength isn't great

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.160
so I have to rely on my brain

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.439
That Sister Xiang

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.319
has been cleaning here

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.399
for eleven years and eight months

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.320
The entire Seg Tower

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:35.679
is like her home

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.919
And then there's Old Li

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.840
His family of three

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.440
They work as a team

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.919
It's about coordination and planning

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.080
to save time

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.240
And his wife, Old Li's wife

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.200
is a real tough one

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.639
Never takes the elevator

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.639
Climbs the stairs every single day

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.200
And his daughter-in-law

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.679
is absolutely unmatched at grabbing orders

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.879
Unmatched at grabbing orders

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.879
She grabs orders faster than anyone

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.759
Come on, come on

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.320
Seg Tower, Seg Tower, send an order

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.600
Every cat has its path, every mouse its hole

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:05.440
So what's Sister Wang's skill?

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:07.200
Listen and I'll tell you slowly

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.279
This building

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320
has seventy-two floors

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.120
Fifty-six elevators

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.559
Odd and even separated

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:13.879
Forty-fifth floor

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:15.639
Sixty-first floor for transfers

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.559
Floors one to ten have escalators

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.320
Above the eleventh floor

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.679
it's office space

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.399
Above the sixty-first floor is the VIP Floors

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.759
VIP Floors

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.519
Facial recognition to enter

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.240
VIP

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:29.120
VIP

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:30.639
She, in these VIP Floors

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:31.519
this access control system

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:32.399
she has her face registered

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.799
Only she doesn't have to tailgate

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.840
She goes straight in

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:37.360
How does she manage that?

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.759
That, I don't know

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.639
This job

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.320
isn't for just anyone

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:46.320
Why?

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.120
You need to run fast

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.159
You must not fear exhaustion

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.240
You need a good brain

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:18.360
I just said, I won't charge you.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.360
You brought me into this business.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.360
Rules of the trade.

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.279
A thank-you to the master.

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:24.840
This... this is embarrassing.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.480
Of course.

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:28.360
There's demand and an information gap.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.320
That creates a secondary market.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.480
It's like Adam Smith.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.559
In "The Wealth of Nations".

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.000
Vanished in an instant.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.879
What route is she taking?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.519
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:46.600
Are you doing this too?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.639
Lao Fan.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.639
What scene haven't you seen?

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.159
You're up.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:56.519
Just scan it.

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:57.960
Yes, yes, two yuan.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.279
Okay.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.759
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.639
This one, right?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.360
Got it.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.240
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.120
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.240
Come on, handsome, handsome!

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:07.759
Come on.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.480
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.480
Alright, come on.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:12.480
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:14.519
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:15.720
Tower runner, right?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.600
Come on.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.279
Thanks for your hard work.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.879
Okay.

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.000
Scan the code!

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:21.240
Scan mine, scan mine!

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.879
Come on, come on.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.000
Stealing my order?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.120
Whoever gets scanned gets the order.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.759
Scanned it.

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.519
Come on, scan it.

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.679
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.080
Alright, thanks!

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.240
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.879
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.600
Seg, Seg, two yuan per order!

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.120
Mom.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.159
Take the money.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.600
Don't be stingy.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.679
Two yuan per order.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.519
Seg, Seg.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.600
One yuan per order.

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:17.639
One yuan per order, right?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.080
Come on, come on.

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:21.279
Come on, scan the code.

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:23.519
Here, here, over here.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.679
Seg, Seg.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.279
One yuan per order.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.960
Scan the code.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.840
Over here, over here, one yuan per order.

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:30.440
One yuan per order!

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.000
One yuan per order.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.080
Miss, miss, over here!

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.519
Come on.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:34.840
Scan the code.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.279
Uh...

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.720
No, scan the code.

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.399
Taking the elevator for the second floor?

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.000
Here, excuse me.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.840
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.960
Excuse me.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.360
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:50.240
Wait, wait.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.399
2451.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.399
Are you kidding me?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.279
I ordered at twelve.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.480
You're half an hour late.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.240
Only now you deliver it.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480
If you do this again, I'll call.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.320
Complain to your company.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.559
Sue you until you're bankrupt.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:07.279
You believe me?

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:07.960
I believe, I believe.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.200
Yuanxin Shidai delivery is late.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.879
Sorry about that.

00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:10.759
Wait, wait.

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:12.039
Where is this delivery for?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.879
Yuanxin Shidai.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:13.759
Then you've got the wrong place.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.399
Look.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.240
We are Jixin Liandai.

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:17.519
What?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.519
No, don't be like this.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:20.279
Sit, sit down.

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:21.000
Sis.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.679
You need to go to Yuanxin Shidai, right?

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:22.120
Yes, yes.

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:23.240
Yuanxin Shidai is on the twenty-second floor.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.399
Take elevator number two in a moment.

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:25.399
Exit left from the elevator.

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:26.279
You'll see that...

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.159
Huaqiang Guangsu Electronic...

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.840
Technology Co., Ltd.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.360
Then turn right.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.879
Then you'll see this Seg...

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.240
Import & Export Trade Co., Ltd.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.759
And then there's this Huanan Intelligent...

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.799
Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:35.080
And then there's a Zhongke Lanxun...

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.919
Communication Technology Co., Ltd.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Then this Electronic Technology...

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.840
Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:38.720
Right across from that...

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:40.039
Is Yuanxin Shidai...

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:41.120
Chip Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.840
Got it.

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:43.360
Exit left.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.200
See the Baldhead Qiang company, then turn right.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.360
What Baldhead Qiang?

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:47.440
You didn't remember a single thing right.

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:56.519
Why is it you again?

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:26.799
Your coffee.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.679
Thank you.

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:28.840
Enjoy your meal.

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:30.759
I don't want this delivery.

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:31.360
If you want me to wait, I'll...

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.679
I must return this.

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:34.039
And all my future deliveries...

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:34.840
I'm going to complain about you.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.600
Take it away, I don't want it.

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:54.200
Everyone, be careful, don't use her service.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.879
Fine.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.039
I'll post it in other groups.

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:58.639
She doesn't look like a decent person.

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:01.759
Darn it.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.399
If I'd known, I wouldn't have given it to her just to save money.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:05.000
Got complaints from three people.

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:06.039
A whole day's work wasted.

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:07.799
I wondered why there was a tower runner...

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:08.840
One yuan per order.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.159
Turns out she doesn't know the way at all.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.120
All the orders I gave her were late.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.639
She looks like an idiot.

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:18.080
If I see her again, I'll hit her.

00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:18.840
What a piece of work.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.960
Brothers who see this message...

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.120
Forward the photo around.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.320
Nobody give her any more orders.

00:16:22.759 --> 00:16:24.399
She'll quit on her own when she can't handle it.
