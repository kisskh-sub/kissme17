00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.850
Hello?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.380
Hairs?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.410
OK, I got it.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.340
Well,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.410
you can send them

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.170
to take a DNA test.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.540
OK.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.060
Mr. Han.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.780
A few long hairs were found

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.940
in the pork shop.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.010
I suspect they're

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.780
the missing girl's.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.850
I've asked the lab

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.610
to take a DNA test.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.340
Alright.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.450
Hello?

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.170
Any new clues?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.130
Mr. Han?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.260
Wan just visited

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.540
the villagers around the cave.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.660
They said

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.890
an unregistered crew

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.100
used to film a video there.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.170
Those spider webs, cocoons,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.130
and dolls

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.380
are abandoned props.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.690
We've verified

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.940
that's true.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.940
The art designer

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.010
has sent the pictures.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.450
Photos.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.820
Thanks.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.780
Mr. Qi.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.060
Photos from the crew.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.290
Han Feng.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.730
The crew should have used

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.660
the ordinary spider web.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.170
But the murderer

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.980
changed it to

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.700
the unique funnel web.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.250
This is a funnel-web spider.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.460
Extremely venomous.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.610
If an adult is bitten,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.980
he'll die in 15 minutes.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.220
The funnel-web spider is

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.610
the most venomous of

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.050
over 30,000 known spider species.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.810
I think

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.700
the murderer might

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.700
imitate the funnel-web spider

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.100
to kill people.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.170
Any grounds?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.780
Ms. Zhu.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.980
Make a video call,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.170
and I'll tell you.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.980
Look at here.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.050
Two pinholes are parallel.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.490
And the skin around

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.050
has been damaged.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.930
This should be the scar

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.170
after injecting

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.020
the neurotoxin.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.460
And here.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.900
These two wounds.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.410
Based on the caliber,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.700
they were likely caused by

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.850
a tubular material like a PVC pipe

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.490
sticking into the body.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.490
There are signs that

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.930
the victim's organs were

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.250
dissolved by a strong acid,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.460
which might be injected

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.340
into the victim's body

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.050
through the wounds.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.340
This modus operandi

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.980
probably simulated

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.460
the spider's way of eating,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.140
like sticking its fangs

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.460
into the prey's body

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.930
and dissolving organs

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.700
with digestive enzymes.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.850
However,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.170
the murderer used a strong acid

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.370
as a substitute.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.100
So, in order to simulate

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.700
the spider's hunting skills,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.340
the murderer wrapped the corpse
with plastic wrap.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.100
Using plastic wrap and alcohol

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.020
to wrap the corpse

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.340
can embalm the corpse

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.900
by isolating the air.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.410
Although the murderer

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.730
killed people like a spider,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.580
that isn't

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.900
the real cause of death

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.410
but this.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.340
See the pinhole behind the ear?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.810
When I studied anatomy

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.100
in Medical University,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.020
to reduce the pain

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.580
of experimental rabbits

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.900
when they were dying,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.100
the school usually

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.900
injected air behind their ears

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.460
to cause an air embolism.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.020
And this can also

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.780
apply to humans.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.540
Why did the murderer do this?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.780
The victim was dead.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.780
It was unnecessary.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.020
The venom and the strong acid.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.370
Not enough?

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.020
Based on the blood coagulation,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.490
the murderer should have

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.980
injected the neurotoxin,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.490
but the victim didn't die.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:45.410
Therefore,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.980
he injected the air.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.020
Someone who knows this

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.810
should have a medical background?

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.660
For now, everything is speculation.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.780
The details...

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.900
We have to wait for

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.540
the toxicology report

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.100
to decide if that is

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.170
the venom of the funnel-web.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.610
Now, that girl

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.980
is still in danger.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.490
We have to find her.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.370
Mr. Han.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.810
Here's a clue.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.220
Last night,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.290
8:17 pm,

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.730
the platform received a call

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.900
from the North Pork Shop.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.580
When the policemen arrived there,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.730
Huang Hao, the reporter,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.700
also the shop's owner,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.460
had died.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.250
The murderer disappeared

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.140
with the kidnapped girl.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.730
In a nearby cave,

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.290
we found a dead woman,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.490
the victim in the cocoon.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.290
The victim has an obvious knife wound,

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.250
deep in her uterus,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.980
causing great damage.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.490
Maybe the murderer hates women.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.810
She also suffered a wound

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.900
in her belly

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.340
after her death.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.460
The length is about 20 centimeters.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.460
Besides, from the time of death,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.050
the victim is probably not

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.140
the kidnapped girl.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.930
This is the rope we found

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.250
in the cave on the North Mountain.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.020
According to the report,

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.220
the DNA

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.610
on it

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.140
doesn't

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.370
match the victim

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.610
in the cocoon.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.780
And look,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.660
the cross section is new.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.930
We also found

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.700
its fiber

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.020
on a nearby stone.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.410
So, it's likely that

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.900
the victim was imprisoned

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.050
in the cave by the murderer,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.930
and then she broke the rope

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.900
with a stone

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.020
and escaped to the pork shop

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.100
to ask for help.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.220
Unluckily,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.250
the murderer found it.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.220
Then he chased to the pork shop,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.700
killed the shop's owner.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.300
Meanwhile,

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.700
he took the victim away.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.130
Based on these clues,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.730
the kidnapped woman

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.460
is probably still in the murderer's hands.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.700
This victim's identity

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.460
has been confirmed.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.650
She's Ye Yingying,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.820
25 years old,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.340
a PR practitioner in a marketing agency.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.770
On October 1st,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.010
her family called the police.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.340
She's been missing for a month?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.460
Yes.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.490
In this time,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.060
any ransom call from the kidnapper?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.610
Not at all.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.130
Colleges in other bureaus

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.460
had investigated her house too.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.130
There was no trace of robbery

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.530
or kidnapping.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.580
In fact, they've been looking for

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.530
the missing woman.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.060
And we just

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.340
found the corpse before them.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.980
Tell them about this.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.730
This case,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.850
due to the jurisdiction,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.820
we'll take it over.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.460
OK.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.700
Any clues about the doll?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.060
Organs in the doll

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.460
are verified as

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.420
a cow's lymph, lung, and intestines.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.700
And we're doing

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.490
a further check.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.940
The murderer is likely

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.580
to have a medical background.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.300
Having some medical knowledge,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.460
meticulous,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.700
pursuing a sense of ritual,

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.100
having some mental problems.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.250
Those dolls

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.610
should be the practice props.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.530
Practice?

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.300
You mean, using living people to learn

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.370
hunting skills like a spider?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.130
Typical antisocial personality disorder.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.420
Was Song Liang questioned?

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:54.980
Yep.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.300
He insisted he's no murderer,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.250
just stealing things.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.300
Surveillance video.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.890
We also compared

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.460
Mr. Qi's anatomical report

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.220
with the result of the on-site survey

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.370
confirmed

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.850
he didn't kill people.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.580
Indeed.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.010
We checked

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.250
all footprints on the site

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.180
and confirmed

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.100
Song Liang stayed on the 2nd floor.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.340
That is to say,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:17.850
now, we have

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.980
hardly any clues

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.300
except for two victims.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.130
Since the crime occurred,

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.460
a dozen hours have passed,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.010
and we still

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.940
can't be sure

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.460
if the victim is still alive.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.220
When we found the victim,

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.730
her feet and hands were tied up.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.180
Maybe the murderer

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.580
imprisoned her for a time

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.180
before killing her.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.130
Don't get upset.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.770
Creatures in nature

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.700
always have

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.420
their unique behavior patterns.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.370
If the murderer indeed

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.490
imitated a spider,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.890
he must have a fixed mode

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.490
of imprisoning others

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.420
and the crime cycle.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.850
Xi.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.300
This is a calendar we found

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.250
in the cave.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.490
There's a mark on "August 1st".

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.980
And on this day,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.610
Ye Yingying's family

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.530
called the police.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.250
The next mark

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.700
is "August 14th".

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.060
A 13-day interval.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.250
It happens to match

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.220
Ye Yingying's death time

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:22.980
I got

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.180
from the autopsy.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.300
If the circle is "kidnapping",

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.580
and the cross is "murder".

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.980
Then, on August 17th,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.060
he kidnapped another person.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.130
And the next killing time...

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.180
August 30th.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.850
If your guess is right,

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.460
we only have

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.340
three days left.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.250
No matter what we do,

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.530
we must save her.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.940
Li,

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.940
try to look for

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.220
all the surveillance videos

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.850
around the scene.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.650
Shops

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.060
and surrounding roads.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.460
As long as the passing car

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.980
has a dash camera,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.420
retrieve the footage.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.610
Besides,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.250
when the victim escaped

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.220
from the cave,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.220
she was pictured.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:08.980
Find her.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.300
We must know who she is.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.180
Wan.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.340
Visit the crime scene,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.490
find out if there are

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.490
more witnesses,

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.890
and ask them whatever you can.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.820
And don't forget the settlement

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.610
around the cave.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.850
The murderer imprisoned

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.770
the victim for a long time.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.980
Don't miss

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.180
anything strange happened

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.180
in this month.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.370
About Ye Yingying,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.300
what was she like at work?

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.340
Su,

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.770
investigate

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.700
Ye Yingying's colleagues

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.580
and family members

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.580
to check anything

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.580
we left out.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.530
Did she have any hobbies?

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.460
She had a love of beauty.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.530
She often went to the aesthetic clinic.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.530
Mr. Han,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.220
documents.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.420
The pork shop is lonely.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.300
No surveillance camera

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.130
within a 5 km radius.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.250
When it's dark,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.220
no car will pass there,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.220
so the traffic police

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.220
have no clues either.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.250
Hello, Su.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.100
What happened?

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:40.980
Mr. Han,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.770
I'm in Ye Yingying's company.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.530
Her colleague said she had no boyfriend.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.490
And she loved dressing up

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.770
and aesthetic courses.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.130
I remembered,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.420
in Mr. Qi's report,

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.610
Ye Yingying's mandible

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.820
has tiny pinholes.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.180
Scars of

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.300
the aesthetic medicine?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.100
Hmm...

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.940
The report of organs

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.130
comes out.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.850
They are from ill cattle.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.250
Suspected to be Bovine TB.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.730
Alright, I got it.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.370
Police station on Unity Road called us.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.220
Someone is missing.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.180
From the description,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.370
it should be our victim.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.340
I'll go there.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.420
Ms. Zhu.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.420
Follow up with Mr. Qi.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:18.850
OK.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.850
Let's go, Mr. Qi.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.460
When did you

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.250
lose her contact?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.460
We'd been contacting on WeChat.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.010
She sent us voice messages

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.060
and made voice calls.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.770
But in the past month or so,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.820
she only sent texts.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.890
We tried to call her,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.890
but she never received it.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.490
Her dad had a birthday a few days ago.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.530
She didn't come back.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.820
We thought it was weird,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.490
so we came to He City.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.650
Ten days ago,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.060
we still had a chat

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.250
promising to visit her.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.370
She said yes.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.010
Any records?

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.300
Here.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.700
However, we found no one

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.250
in her house.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.890
Everything was covered with dust.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.100
We went to

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.530
the hospital where she worked.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.460
Until then,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.890
she'd quit the job for a month.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.770
As you were in He City,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.650
did she contact you?

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.250
We've been here for a week

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.890
but couldn't find her.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.060
So we called the police.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.250
A week?

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:01.730
Yes.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:14.850
The biological institute

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.850
has been excluded.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.580
Among nearby universities,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.820
only this agricultural university

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.530
is researching

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.530
bovine TB.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.220
It hasn't broken out

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.610
for ages in this province.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.580
Maybe this is an individual case.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.460
And those organs.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.980
Although corroded

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.820
by hydrochloric acid,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.250
we can still recognize

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.100
the scar caused by the operation.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.610
Bovine TB spreads through

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.220
droplets in the air and dust.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.220
It mainly infects airways

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.890
and then digestive tracts.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.300
One and a half months ago,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.100
we indeed experimented on

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.300
bovine TB.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.250
But all the samples

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.250
had been decontaminated

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.980
after the experiment.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.140
They couldn't spread.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.860
What if some students

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.730
took them out secretly?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.570
Impossible.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:13.810
Prof. Wang.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.140
This is the tissue slice.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.620
With this,

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.490
please help us confirm

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.980
if it's the same type

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.140
as what you used

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.940
for the experiment.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.490
And a list of participants

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.460
in this experiment.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.490
Please provide it

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.050
for us.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.290
You're suspecting

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.010
it's relevant

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.140
to the school?

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.620
Prof. Wang,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.730
do you know if

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.940
someone raises spiders?

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.460
Is she afraid of spiders?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.010
Spiders...

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.980
Spiders?

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.980
Yaoqi is the most afraid of spiders.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.860
There was a little one in the house.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.530
She saw it

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.980
and was scared to go back.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.380
Did this

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.860
have anything to do with

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.660
her missing?

00:17:59.400 --> 00:17:59.770
No.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.180
Not yet.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.660
Alright.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.180
We're almost done.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.770
We'll inform you of new information.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.180
Please follow me

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.180
to complete the transcript.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.940
Need a long time?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.770
Yaoqi's friend is

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.810
waiting for us downstairs.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.700
Friend?

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.900
Oh,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.900
that's it.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.700
When we visited Yaoqi's house,

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.380
we met her.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.660
She sent us here

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.620
with enthusiasm.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:37.460
Hello.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.940
No, thanks.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.220
You're Yaoqi's friend?

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.570
Yep.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.770
Did they finish the statement?

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.980
Why don't you come upstairs?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.090
Your name?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.770
I'm Li Shuting,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.860
Yaoqi's colleague.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:05.860
There's something

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.620
I can't say

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.090
in front of her parents.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.050
What?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.090
I didn't tell them

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.290
Yaoqi was actually fired.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.570
Why?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.090
She did a part-time job.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.700
A part-time job?

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.900
In an aesthetic clinic.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.860
Her parents

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.220
wanted her to come home and get married.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.980
But she had a love of beauty.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.730
So...

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.140
So what?

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.530
The money she made

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.330
was put into the clinic.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.770
Having a part-time job there

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.220
can offer

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.490
an employee discount.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.220
I'm in Ye Yingying's company.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.730
Her colleague said she had no boyfriend.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.980
And she loved dressing up.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.490
Ye Yingying's mandible

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.770
has tiny pinholes.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.570
Scars of

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.570
the aesthetic medicine?

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.380
You've seen her parents, right?

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.180
From the countryside,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.490
they're conservative.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.570
How could they agree

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.090
on plastic surgeries?

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.860
So Yaoqi

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.090
kept hiding herself.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.250
I think Yaoqi

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.620
didn't disappear.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.770
Where is the clinic

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.290
she worked in?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.940
I have a name card.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.900
Here you are.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.290
I'd also been there.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.530
Yaoqi said

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.530
the clinic has no compliance,

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.660
but it had a lower price.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.980
Don't worry too much.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.620
We'll try our best to find her.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.250
Contact us

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.140
if you have any problems.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.980
OK.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.290
Hey.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.620
Are you alright?

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.220
Yes.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.730
Be careful.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.460
Sir.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.860
You're weak.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.180
I'll help you.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.940
Your phone number.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.250
Make a statement afterwards.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.570
Can you keep a secret

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.380
from her parents

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.250
about what I've said?

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.530
She'll be angry if she knows this.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.460
OK.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.420
I gotta go.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.900
Let's go.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.620
Give it to me.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.620
What's that?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.380
Zhu.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:39.940
Mr. Qi.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.050
Here's the comparison result

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.980
of the bovine TB

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.250
from Prof. Wang.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.180
This is a name list

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.490
of the participants, and photos.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.700
Besides,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.050
Prof. Wang had

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.900
a reliable alibi.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.660
He was at home that night.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.700
Confirmed.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.810
The organs are from

00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.490
the experiment.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.090
Therefore,

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.530
the murderer is one of those

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.380
who participated in

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.090
this experiment.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.570
Is every student here?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:13.810
Yes.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:14.530
Oh.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.810
Six students haven't arrived.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.810
Zhu.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.570
Xi assembled all the students

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.620
who participated in

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.770
the bovine TB experiment.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.250
They're here.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.940
Everybody, be quiet, okay?

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.570
Please cooperate with us.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.290
Name list.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.620
Six students haven't arrived yet.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.660
They're on vacation.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.860
Let's go.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.660
I'm Luo Hongcai.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.250
Luo Hongcai.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.570
On the evening of Aug. 26th,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.660
where were you?

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.140
At home.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.570
Your age?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.420
Nineteen.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:43.860
Nineteen?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.290
Yes.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.980
Do you know them?

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.860
Yes.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.860
My classmates.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.050
How many people are in your dorm?

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.660
Four.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.810
Where were you that day?

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.860
I was at home.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.490
The dorm's gate has a camera.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.810
You can have a check.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.010
I promise I didn't go out.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.420
Who can prove it?

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.860
I was sleeping.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.860
How did I do that?

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.980
No one in your house?

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.900
Can you tell me

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.660
your parents' names?

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.570
Usually, the girls' dorm...

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.620
When you had a class,

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.250
did you notice

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.090
any strange people?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.900
Sorry, I didn't.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.530
Alright.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.420
Sign here.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.660
Why is the clinic here?

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.380
It isn't unregistered, dude.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.620
Be careful.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.330
OK.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.380
Sir.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.180
We're closed.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.050
See you.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:46.220
Police.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.460
Why are you here?

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.250
Hey.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:02.530
Hmm...

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.010
Just... Just the glucose solution.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.180
For myself.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.570
Sir, I...

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.050
What's your business?

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.250
Tuina.
[*A kind of Chinese massage]

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.140
Unregistered clinic?

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.330
No, no, no.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.700
Not at all.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.180
Sit down!

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.290
Sit down.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.460
What do you do here?

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.050
Tuina.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.570
Need so many things?

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:03.420
Medical license?

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.730
Show me.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.570
Sir.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.220
Just some small business.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.570
I did nothing bad.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.050
Nothing bad?

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.380
Then listen to my question.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.290
Know her?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.620
No.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.900
Think twice and answer me.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.250
If there's nothing else,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:31.860
I'm leaving.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.460
Ms. Zhu.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.730
I've asked everyone reachable.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.050
Excluded their suspicion.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.220
The rest are either out of town

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.050
or back home.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.180
I'll keep contacting.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:46.460
OK.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.380
We don't have much time.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.250
Quick as possible.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:57.620
I know her.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.380
She was my nurse

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.700
as a part-time job.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.380
These medicines.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.730
She brought them from the hospital

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.180
and sold them here.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:07.770
This woman?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.250
Maybe.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.810
Have no impression.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:15.980
Look up.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.180
Look up!

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.250
Did you kill her?

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.140
Killed... Killed her?

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.180
No, no, no.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.050
Impossible!

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.330
How can I kill her?

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.940
Why killed her? How?

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.250
You wronged me.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.940
How dare I kill her?

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.420
Just a skin-whitening injection.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.730
It can't make her die.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.770
Her cause of death.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.010
How can I know that?

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.220
I didn't kill her!

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.010
This girl had an anesthesia allergy.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.770
How?

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.730
She came here for an injection.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.140
The moment she received the anesthesia,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.530
she began convulsing

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.220
and fainted.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:49.900
Yaoqi...

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.220
Yingying.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.620
Yingying!

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.620
Yingying!

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.140
Dong!

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.330
What happened?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.940
Is she allergic?

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.460
Allergic.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.460
Yingying.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.530
Hello?

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.380
Where are you?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.860
Come... Come here quickly.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.730
Bad thing!

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:05.570
Hurry up!

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:06.490
Then... Then...

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.700
Then you saved her.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.770
No, no, no.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.380
I didn't know that.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.180
What?

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.180
Speaking.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.490
Sir.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.090
I beg you.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.810
If I tell you,

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.290
don't stop my nephew

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.530
from being a doctor, okay?

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.050
Say it.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.530
I have a nephew.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.140
He's learning to be a doctor.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.090
What doctor?

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.810
An animal doctor
in Agricultural University.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.140
But...

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.140
As he came here,

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.460
he cured this girl.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.490
Afterwards, the girl

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.530
left here alone.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.380
You can check

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.380
the surveillance video.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.290
She walked out,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.220
safe and sound.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.290
I'm done. Send them away.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.620
Hello, Mr. Han?

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.490
Ms. Zhu.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.620
Help me find

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.730
if a student's surname

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.420
is Liao.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.900
Let me have a look.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.330
Yes.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.860
There is a student

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.010
called Liao Yunsheng.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.660
Your nephew is Liao Yunsheng?

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.490
Yes. Yes.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.090
That's him.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.660
Anyone questioned a student

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.770
called Liao Yunsheng?

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.460
Nope.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.530
Me either.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.530
Liao Yunsheng?

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:25.980
Liao Yunsheng.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.700
I didn't.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.250
No.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.700
Where's your nephew?

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.090
I've lost his contact

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:35.980
for a while.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.490
Maybe he returned to his hometown.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.090
Is he in school, or anywhere else?

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.290
Did he rent a house?

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.860
This kid

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.810
had few communications with me.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.460
When something happened,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.860
I called him.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.380
I really don't know.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.770
I'm not lying.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.900
I really don't know that.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.090
Thank you

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.810
and your students

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:58.900
for the cooperation.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.660
You're welcome.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.420
Take care.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.250
Bye.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.490
Then we're leaving.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:02.900
OK.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.460
It's late.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:03.980
Goodbye.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.050
Guys. Guys!

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:05.940
Wait a second.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.330
Do you know

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.220
Liao Yunsheng?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.660
Do you know him?

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.770
Unfamiliar with him?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.330
Liao Yunsheng.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.570
I... I'm familiar with him.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:20.940
His home?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.620
Wu Village.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.570
Wu Village.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.090
Take him back

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.330
and confiscate this shop.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.090
No problem.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.660
Be careful.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:17.900
Here it is.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.090
I'll check houses next to it.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.010
OK.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:23.090
Take care.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.810
OK.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.330
Xi, follow me.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.460
There's no

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.810
funnel-web spider.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.010
Mr. Han.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.380
Look,

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.860
this is Ye Yingying,

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.090
the first victim.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.140
These two are Xie Yaoqi.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.460
Did he draw pictures

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.420
of all the victims?

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:36.530
Who's this?

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.570
Don't tell me

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.660
this is the third victim.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.090
I'm Li Shuting,

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.530
Yaoqi's colleague.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:56.900
Your phone number.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.570
I gotta go.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.810
I've seen her.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.660
Evidence all points to Liao Yunsheng.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.330
He's the prime suspect in this case.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.010
Do you know a kind of people

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.180
imagining themselves as animals?

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.330
Clinical lycanthropy.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.010
This is a mental illness.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.330
Thirteen days

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.140
is the interval

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.420
between mating and egg-laying.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.700
There were no signs

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.010
of sexual assault on Yingying's body.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.050
It's dark. Sound of machinery.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:11.900
We split up

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.130
to find suspected places.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.340
You've met Liao Yunsheng.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.420
Is that him?

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.690
Center the search on the clinic,

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.010
check all surrounding crossroads.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.050
We can't let him go this time.
