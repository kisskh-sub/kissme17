=Episode 23=

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:10.746
Report!

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.065
Your Highness, urgent news.

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:15.345
What is it?

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.065
His Majesty is gravely ill.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.122
(Urgent report. The Emperor
is critically ill and near death.)

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:23.420
(The situation is dire.
Please come at once.)

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:30.226
At this point, advancing or retreating
both lead to death.

00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:32.866
My top priority now is to return
to Mobei and ascend the throne.

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.705
Once I command the hundred thousand
iron cavalry of Mobei,

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:37.545
Cangzhou will not dare to act rashly.

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:39.026
Your Highness, you mean...

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:40.425
Issue the order.

00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:42.106
We depart for Mobei immediately.

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:43.265
Also,

00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:45.104
have you found Ru's whereabouts?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.265
I am incompetent.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.625
I only discovered she was sent
out of the capital.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.226
As for where she went...

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:53.625
After I ascend the throne,

00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:58.065
I will spare no effort of Mobei
to find her.

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:03.705
An imperial oral decree.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.505
I appoint Yuwen Que
to inherit the throne,

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:08.466
to ascend immediately.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:10.026
Assassins!

00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:17.584
What a fine show.

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.184
A new Emperor ascends,

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:20.945
old lovers reunite.

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:22.385
Let her go!

00:02:22.546 --> 00:02:23.426
Don't move.

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:25.344
I can't bear to hurt you.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.945
What have you turned into?

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:32.304
What have I become?

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:35.345
For ten whole years,

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.744
I've been trapped in this gilded cage,

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:40.786
seeing through
all the world's hypocrisy.

00:02:40.787 --> 00:02:42.074
What do you want?

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:44.744
This country should have belonged
to the Su family.

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.865
The Mobei royal family seized
my ancestors' legacy,

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.466
imprisoned me for ten years,

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:49.665
and now,

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:54.945
you would take away the one I love most.

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:58.105
Do you remember what you said
at the border that year

00:02:58.106 --> 00:03:00.344
that you would be a general
who would not fail the world?

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:01.706
That foolish boy

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:04.706
has long been dead.

00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:07.945
Choose.

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:11.266
The throne or her.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.026
The Su Army has pledged allegiance
to the new Emperor.

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:23.466
Don't move!

00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:28.546
General.

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:31.266
Put down the blade. Stop now.

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:33.345
Even you betray me?

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:48.665
Without you,

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:51.746
what use is

00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:54.625
this country to me?

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:12.665
It's over.

00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:16.625
Please, spare him.

00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:19.266
I never sought the throne.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.306
I only wished to earn merit and glory,

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:24.145
to keep you safe.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:30.306
But this world... This human heart...

00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:37.465
Father, I've failed you.

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:39.785
Take him away.

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:41.065
Guard him well.

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:55.505
Your Ladyship.

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:57.944
Why the panic?

00:04:57.945 --> 00:05:00.065
His Majesty has ascended the throne.

00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:03.426
Has an Empress been appointed?

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:04.545
This...

00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:05.546
Speak.

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:10.306
His Majesty has named Shen Qingru
as Empress.

00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:12.346
What did you say?

00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:18.546
Impossible.

00:05:20.026 --> 00:05:21.145
Isn't she...

00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:25.786
Isn't she already dead?

00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:45.226
In what way am I inferior to her?

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:50.625
I am Princess Wen Ling.

00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:52.866
Your Ladyship is indeed
peerlessly beautiful.

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:57.866
Quick, change my clothes.

00:05:58.145 --> 00:05:59.825
I'll wear that phoenix robe.

00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:03.465
Do you think I should be the Empress?

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:07.065
That phoenix robe suits me perfectly.

00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:10.306
I'm nobler than her.

00:06:11.426 --> 00:06:13.106
I'm more beautiful than her.

00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:15.465
I...

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:20.145
I...

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:28.945
Don't cry.

00:06:30.505 --> 00:06:31.666
I mustn't cry.

00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:33.505
Wen Ling.

00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:35.666
Be elegant.

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:38.025
Be dignified.

00:07:08.986 --> 00:07:10.106
So it turns out

00:07:11.586 --> 00:07:14.426
in the end, I was nothing at all.

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:42.346
Your Ladyship.

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:09.705
I've made my decision.

00:08:18.786 --> 00:08:22.025
Your Majesty, Her Ladyship requests
you go to Wen Ling Palace at once.

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:23.744
At this hour?

00:08:23.745 --> 00:08:25.306
Let's go together.

00:08:25.586 --> 00:08:26.346
Alright.

00:08:34.786 --> 00:08:36.265
You're here.

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:38.145
How nice.

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:39.666
Wen Ling.

00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:45.105
Do you remember
when I first entered the palace?

00:08:45.905 --> 00:08:47.426
I was just a tiny little thing,

00:08:48.505 --> 00:08:51.146
hiding behind Auntie,
too afraid to come out.

00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:53.465
Back then,

00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:58.225
my whole world was just Auntie and you.

00:08:58.265 --> 00:09:00.065
Wait for me!

00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:01.384
Wait for me!

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:03.570
Wait for me!

00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:04.945
After Auntie passed away,

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.057
I became even more afraid,

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:11.426
afraid of being alone,

00:09:11.905 --> 00:09:13.506
afraid of being abandoned.

00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:22.065
So I always followed behind you,

00:09:24.025 --> 00:09:28.186
step by step, walking in your shadow.

00:09:32.306 --> 00:09:36.945
I thought that way I would
never lose you.

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:39.825
How ridiculous.

00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:43.105
Ever since you met Shen Qingru,

00:09:44.706 --> 00:09:47.225
you were willing
to give up everything for her,

00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:49.825
even your status as a prince.

00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:52.465
But did you ever think

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:55.426
the moment you chose to let go,

00:09:57.946 --> 00:10:00.026
where was I supposed to go?

00:10:01.346 --> 00:10:02.465
Wen Ling.

00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:05.225
Let me finish.

00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:11.345
From childhood until now,

00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:14.825
there was only you in my eyes.

00:10:16.706 --> 00:10:18.225
But

00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:23.026
you left me behind.

00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:28.266
I'm sorry.

00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:33.465
So I hated.

00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:36.426
I hated until I went mad.

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:41.546
That day in court,

00:10:41.946 --> 00:10:43.906
I knelt and begged the Emperor

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:47.345
to grant marriage to General Su
and Shen Qingru.

00:10:48.385 --> 00:10:49.705
I thought

00:10:50.946 --> 00:10:52.666
as long as I tore you apart,

00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:55.825
I could keep you by my side.

00:10:56.226 --> 00:10:57.865
Only now do I understand

00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:01.065
that I never truly understood
what love was.

00:11:03.785 --> 00:11:05.225
From childhood to now,

00:11:06.745 --> 00:11:09.065
I was like someone without direction,

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:12.504
desperately clinging
to the only familiar shadow.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.065
You became everything I chased.
