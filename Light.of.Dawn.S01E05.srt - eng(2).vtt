00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.400
(People's Public Security)
The 1009 Penglai Plaza Case

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.920
has entered a new phase.

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.920
The investigation
has two main lines of inquiry.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.870
First, Wang Dan,
who drove the car into the statue,

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:04.688
was very likely instigated
by another person.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.470
The statements of
Xu Zhiyang, Wu Feifei, and Wu Guohao

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.360
are inconsistent.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.750
They'll be questioned on suspicion
of obstructing official duties.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.750
The remains were identified as the
mother of a local resident, Gao Feng.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.520
It's worth noting

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.400
that Gao Feng's
adoptive father, Gao Dahua,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.310
died by suicide
on the day of the incident.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.520
(The person who prompted
Gao Dahua's suicide)

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.240
(is connected to
the first line of inquiry.)

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:27.111
(We suspect)

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.630
(that someone deliberately merged
these two lines of inquiry.)

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.149
(Case Briefing)
The motive remains unclear.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.080
(Adoptive father, Gao Dahua (suicide))
The key individual is Gao Feng.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.750
She said something strange to me.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.590
After the old man's death,
the person who follows me

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.430
is her.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.030
She's the same person

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:42.488
who deliberately led him
to the Penglai Plaza incident site.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.870
Based on statements
from Zhang Jing and Gao Feng,

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.222
as well as surveillance footage
from Wang Dan's hospital,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.680
we've made a preliminary determination
that the person who approached Wang Dan,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.960
(Scammed Gao Dahua)
the scammer who targeted Gao Dahua,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.822
and the person who provided leads
to Gao Feng

00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:54.750
are all the same woman.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.680
She

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.030
once stayed at a guesthouse
in West City

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.310
using a forged ID.

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:01.360
The guesthouse owner referred to her
as Madam He.

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.822
On the day we confirmed that
the remains inside the statue

00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:05.470
belonged to Gao Feng's
biological mother,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.933
she checked out of the guesthouse.

00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:08.030
She's currently missing.

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:11.460
Surveillance footage from the ferry
terminal, bus stations, and the airport

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:13.120
shows that she did not leave Binchuan.

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:16.200
Besides, further review of surveillance
footage from Wang Dan's hospital

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:18.560
(Road Surveillance Camera)
and surrounding hotels indicates

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.360
that a young woman frequently appeared
together with Madam He.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.066
(Passage)
Plus, Zhang Jing also mentioned

00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.711
that someone else was staying
with Madam He at the small hotel.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.840
We believe

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.360
that this young woman
is Madam He's accomplice.

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.500
It'd be ideal to find the person
who put Wang Dan up to this

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.080
and settle it privately ahead of time.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.590
Not just that,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.360
we need to figure out what she's after.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.590
Understood.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.240
I'll draft a plan.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.240
If it's a relative or family member,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.430
we'll focus on calming things down
and minimizing social impact.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.590
If it's a business rival,

00:03:50.822 --> 00:03:52.360
we prepare for a commercial fight.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.120
Feifei, if you hear anything,
get in touch immediately.

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:57.800
Be careful with communication tools.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.590
If possible, talk face-to-face.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.030
Use personal connections
as little as possible.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.022
The fewer people who know, the better.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.510
Gao Feng.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.120
You didn't sleep again?

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.190
Scared, aren't you?

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.040
My mom's been dead for years.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.430
She's been buried under the statue.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.310
For over twenty years.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.240
Just now, your other mom came to see me.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.480
Give me a shot.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.560
Tim, get Madam a glass of juice.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.480
Alright.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480
No need for the trouble.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.680
It tastes the same.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.360
Not worth that much money.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.390
I'm not someone who drinks juice.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.800
Gao Feng hasn't come into work yet.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.070
If you have something to say,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.630
you can talk to him yourself.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.020
(Dog's Nose)

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.830
I came to see you.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.720
Madam Zhang.

00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:25.133
About what happened to Gao Feng,

00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:27.750
I can't talk him out of it.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.920
Honestly,

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.360
after all this turmoil these past days,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.920
I actually think he feels
more like a real person now.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.310
I don't really care

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.720
whether his case will be fully cleared
in the end.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.040
But when someone's young,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.920
if they can devote themselves
to one thing

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.510
and fight for it,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.120
even being crushed repeatedly,
it's not a wasted life.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.310
Girl,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.310
if Gao Feng can't settle down,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.040
don't wait for him.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.390
There's nothing I can do to stop him.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.800
You're a fine young lady.

00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:20.240
Don't let this hold you back.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.190
Some things only hurt more
when you force them.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.430
Thanks to you,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.040
I have to fight

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.920
against the law of attraction
every single day.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.720
You

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.630
and everything around you

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.430
are something else, really.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.630
You have to overcome your own hurdle.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.000
Sirs,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.800
the case is getting more closely tied
to the Gao family.

00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:51.360
I think I should step aside.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.160
The lead on Wang Dan

00:07:54.177 --> 00:07:56.040
and all information
related to the Wu family,

00:07:56.044 --> 00:07:57.377
I'll hand over to He Xiaoyang.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.160
As for Zhang Jing and Gao Feng,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.270
Zhao will follow up.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.480
On the technical investigation side,

00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:04.390
Jiaqi and Jiang are stronger than I am.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.310
Asking for approval
after everything's arranged?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.040
No.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.510
Give me a reason.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.310
(Brave in spirit, elegant at heart)

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.270
Gao Dahua and I...

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.720
This is an objective reason.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.560
Objectively speaking,
you're not related by blood.

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:17.933
So there's no need to recuse yourself.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.800
But if it's a subjective reason,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.040
give me your reason.

00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:25.666
It's because of my relationship
with the Gao family.

00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:27.400
I'm worried it'll affect my judgment.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.510
If I were you,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.430
I'd make good use of that connection,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.120
not back away from it.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.150
Gao Feng is a key figure.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.000
Our first priority is to keep him safe.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.790
Besides,

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.270
if we need him to cooperate
with the investigation,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.720
who should talk to him

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.480
and how?

00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:46.120
Is there really anyone
more suitable than you?

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.670
Are you afraid your personal feelings
for Gao Dahua

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.390
could compromise your objectivity?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.720
As policemen,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.000
we're bound to face things
that stir our emotions.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.910
Carrying out our duties calmly

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.600
is the best and only way.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.440
This case is also
part of your own trial.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.620
(Kind Father Gao Dahua)

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.320
Godfather,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.510
take care of yourself over there.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.550
Go easy on the salt.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.150
If you're bored,
you can chat with my parents.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.670
Once I wrap things up,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.670
I'll come and drink with you.

00:09:45.733 --> 00:09:46.888
Since you're already here,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.030
don't hide anymore.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.790
Come out.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.910
These are the contact details
of all employees

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.480
from the period
when the incident happened.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.320
This is the list
of the construction workers.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.670
Back then,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.720
I also reached out to some in public
security and the medical system.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.870
They said

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.600
that after the incident,
a lot of people were contacted.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.600
But the ones who knew
there was a body inside the statue

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:18.910
are probably just these people.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.000
Some of these connections

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.720
were the ones I smoothed over.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.133
I thought I'd cleaned everything up.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.630
Never thought

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.870
something would slip through.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.480
Your dad was a mid-level officer
at the subdistrict office.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.870
He only went to work with Mr. Xu
after he resigned.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.750
In those days, doing business
mostly depended on connections.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.720
Don't make it sound so mysterious.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.390
Back then, if you were in business,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.840
people who'd worked in government

00:10:52.888 --> 00:10:54.149
understood the rules better.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.090
They knew how to get things done better
than figuring it out from scratch.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.000
That was normal.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.720
Say,

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.840
Lawyer Cao hasn't been with the company
for long.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.390
Explain it to him.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.200
Tell him not to
settle everything privately.

00:11:08.222 --> 00:11:09.630
We should do things the right way.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.200
Follow proper procedures.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.240
We're not the mob.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.600
Understood.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.550
Feifei.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.000
Leave the older generation's mess to us.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.440
You go abroad and take a break.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.670
No.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.240
If someone here has a problem,

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.870
that's your responsibility.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.270
Figuring out who knows Wang Dan

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.270
and who has ties to her,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.240
that's my responsibility.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.750
Dad,

00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:48.670
that day Su Min asked me something.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.080
She said,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.870
"Besides the person in the photo,

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.790
Miss Wu, have you encountered

00:11:54.266 --> 00:11:56.444
any other suspicious people
or incidents lately?"

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.200
Don't you find that strange?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.440
I think

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.240
there's more than one person involved.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.550
And someone might be right next to me.

00:12:20.133 --> 00:12:22.733
You stood up for your mom
at the police station that day.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.360
That was pretty manly.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.150
Do you all think I'm being dramatic?

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.200
I want to pretend nothing ever happened.

00:12:32.422 --> 00:12:33.960
I want my family to live peacefully.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.630
But I just can't.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.480
Ever since I can remember,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.080
it's like I've been wound up tight.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.960
If I don't figure out who I am

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.120
and what happened in the past,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.440
I can't stop.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.670
That's my fate.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.440
This number was found
on the old man's phone.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.390
That woman's phone
has been off the whole time.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.600
Stop calling.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.910
We're monitoring that number.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.960
She came well-prepared.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.320
She won't be easy to track down.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.840
There's always a way.

00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:16.200
Gao Feng, I'll say this one more time.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.720
Don't do anything reckless.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.750
You're a key figure in this case now.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.320
I've been ordered

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.440
to protect you.

00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:25.360
If anything happens on your end,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.750
report it to us immediately.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.000
This is a society of laws.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.422
No matter how deep criminals hide,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.150
they'll be dug out sooner or later.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.870
Actually,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.840
I warned Mr. Gao long ago

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.240
that the woman might be a scammer.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.270
But he was completely taken in.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.440
He wouldn't listen to me.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.720
Now that he's gone,

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.510
I'm frustrated as well.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.240
I feel the same as you do.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.390
I have to get to the bottom of this.

Relax. It's not poisoned.

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:09.688
You were still young
when your father passed away, right?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.910
Fourteen or fifteen?

00:14:11.666 --> 00:14:13.577
What kind of business
was he involved in?

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.840
Did he fall out with anyone?

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.580
My dad rarely talked to me
about business.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.630
I don't know anything.

And someone might be right next to me.

Wu Feifei, we've known each other
for over ten years.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.670
Are you suspecting me

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.550
of sending Wang Dan to ram the statue?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.000
(Why aren't you suspecting
Amy or Jingjing?)

00:15:34.358 --> 00:15:35.150
I'm fine.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.030
Come in.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.510
Boss,

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.030
we pulled some strings

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.390
and got the forensics result.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.080
The person inside the statue
had a child.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.200
A son.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.030
He's in Binchuan.

Gao.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.000
You knew everything,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.111
and you kept it from me
till the day you died.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.670
But a child looking for his mother
is only right.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.840
I can't stop him anymore.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.750
If you can see him from up there,

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.480
watch over him.
Don't let him get into trouble.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.270
Nothing can happen to him.

Go back and get some rest.

No need. I'll grab a coffee later.

I remember now.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.920
A few days ago, when I visited Mr. Gao,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.680
Gao Feng told me

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.480
there was someone besides Madam He

We're police.

Where is this person?

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.070
She just resigned. Just left.

Stop the car.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.590
Answer my question first.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.550
Stop the car!

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.030
The police just called me.

00:18:18.066 --> 00:18:19.444
They said they might've found you.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.270
Tell me.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.640
What else do you know?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.790
(People's Public Security)
She ran?

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.720
She's just a girl.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.790
And you let her run?

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.110
You can't even handle this.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.030
What can you do?

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.510
I'm sorry.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.350
- I...
- No, Sir.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.880
You're right.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.880
I messed up.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.200
Give me two days.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:57.750

Their butler, Zhao Tiaming,
has been moving around lately.

Seems like he's looking for someone.

00:19:07.555 --> 00:19:09.622
Not sure if it's the same person
we're looking for.

tell me the name.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.830
I'll have someone check.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.200
What's wrong?

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.440
I don't know his name.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.000
I don't know anything about him.
I'm sorry.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.960
I thought he was just a normal friend.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.440
He... He couldn't be

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.640
connected to this.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.440
Did you tell him about Wang Dan?

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.880
No. We agreed

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.755
that we wouldn't ask anything
we shouldn't.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.440
But...

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.830
What if he had other intentions...

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.830
Enough, Feifei.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.720
Don't get involved anymore.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.440
Japan or the U.S.,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.030
pick one.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.830
Dad, can I stay?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.440
Let me try on my own.

00:20:04.888 --> 00:20:06.200
Leave as soon as possible.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.270
If you don't, you could be
stopped at the border.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.310
Dad.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.310
Be good.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.640
This is my mess...

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.830
Just let me handle it!

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.200
Feifei,

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.310
calm down.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.400
You and your daughter are doing this
for each other.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.590
Don't ruin your relationship over it.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.510
I saw her photo at the police station.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.550
It's her.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:48.550
Ming,

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.440
our nightmare is back.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.750
It's back.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.640
I'm using some old contacts
to look into it.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.480
Lawyer Cao warned us before.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.830
We should keep a low profile.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.880
That's why progress has been slow.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.240
Feifei is a lead, one way or another.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.680
Why not take a chance?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.880
It's too dangerous.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.350
Risk is like a wave.
Run from it, and it'll crash you.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.200
But face it head-on,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.350
and things might turn around.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.310
That's what you taught me back then.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.240
The trouble's already there.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.240
We can't dodge it.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.030
Feifei really takes after you.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.310
If you don't let her try,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.160
she'll never be at peace with it.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.790
Feeling better now?

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.440
Not shouting at me now?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:11.880
Dad, I...

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.680
You should thank Mr. Ming.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.880
He spoke up for you.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.680
But let me be clear.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.750
This is the only time.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.160
If it doesn't work out,
leave immediately.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.400
Alright, Dad.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.200
Tell us your plan.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.550
The strangest thing about this person is

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.550
that ever since the incident,
he's been keeping out of sight.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.350
We need to draw him out first

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.240
and figure out his intention.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.440
Only then can we decide
how to deal with him.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.270
Mr. Wu.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.640
Feifei.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.590
Lawyer Cao.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.240
Mr. Ming.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.000
When we tried to track him down,
the police caught on.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.480
They put you two under surveillance

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.550
on suspicion of giving false testimony.

00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:54.590
The police are stationed outside
right now.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.030
Boss, there are three cars outside.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.480
Su Min is in charge.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.160
Mr. Ming, buy two dragon fruits for me.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.880
Lawyer Cao, I need a backup phone.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.830
Feifei, as for communication tools...

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.960
Do exactly as she said.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.440
Let her try.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.270
The number you have dialed
is powered off.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.070
Please try again later.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.200
No matter where you are,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.590
I'll find you.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.909
(Bestie: I know
what you're trying to do.)

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.666
(Let's meet tonight at nine.)

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.580
(Unknown number: Do you want to know
what happened at Penglai Plaza?)

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.750
What's wrong?

00:24:05.155 --> 00:24:06.688
She's allergic to dragon fruit.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.160
We're usually very careful.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.920
We've been too busy and overlooked it.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.510
Officer Su,

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.310
why don't you come with us?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.110
Alright. We'll lead the way.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.270
Thank you so much.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.220
(Emergency Medicine Department)

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.940
(Jiren Hospital)

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.240
You'll leave through
the rear safety passage later.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.030
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.160
Send my regards to your father.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.750
Hello.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.640
How can I help you?

00:25:28.355 --> 00:25:29.800
Let me take a look at the patient.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.020
(Where are you?)

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.420
(Bestie: I'm here.)

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:59.900
(I'm inside. I don't see you.)

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.260
(Bestie: Back door.)

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.240
They've arrived.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.030
Yeah.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.480
Yes, right here.

00:26:23.511 --> 00:26:24.822
- Let's go.
- Why are you so late?

00:26:24.844 --> 00:26:25.577
I've been waiting.

00:26:25.577 --> 00:26:26.030
Let's go.

00:26:26.066 --> 00:26:26.990
The traffic is terrible.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.400
Don't get anxious.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.480
It's packed tonight.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.400
I've been waiting for you!
What took you so long?

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.310
Alright.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.310
Let's go.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.000
You know what?

00:26:34.688 --> 00:26:36.422
We're going to drink
to our fill tonight.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:51.590
Hello?

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.260
(Bestie)

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.030
Bestie?

00:27:04.533 --> 00:27:05.550
I'm just as surprised

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:06.680
as you are.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.350
This phone belongs to another person
connected to the case.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.200
He claims he received messages

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.310
that are crucial to the investigation.

00:27:14.688 --> 00:27:15.960
What's your relationship

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.640
with the bestie you mentioned?

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.310
Wu Feifei,

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.110
stop hiding things from us.

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.350
Why do you call him your bestie?

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.200
We met drinking.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.088
Are you two close?

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.750
We got along pretty well,
so we became friends.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.590
You met here?

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.160
Take a look. Is this the bestie
you've been looking for?

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.220
(Flashback)

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.350
Boss, I've settled the bill.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.400
Alright.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.790
Sorry. Sorry.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.720
Excuse me.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.880
Sit for a bit. Come on.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.622
Let's make friends.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.030
It's fine.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:38.920
Go away!

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.830
Sit.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.110

(Maybe through her,)

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.133
(I could find out
the truth about my birth.)

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.580
(Wu Feifei)

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.380
(Bestie)

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.240
The bestie is Gao Feng, right?

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:58.711
(Unlocking)

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.920
Why aren't you answering his call?

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.200
I don't really know

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.110
how to talk to him right now.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.150
But the police said

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.760
Wang Dan had nothing to do with him.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.070
I was overthinking it.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.510
It was the woman in the wheelchair

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.110
who told Wang Dan to ram the statue.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.590
But the body inside the statue,

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.670
her son, is my bestie.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.960
Dad, do you think
all of this is a coincidence?

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.880
Do you know anything else?

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.670
I... I know a little.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.070
I didn't tell you before

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.911
because I didn't want you
to worry too much.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.920
Gao Feng's mother

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.880
wasn't a construction worker's
family member.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.920
She was a singer-dancer
at the International Club.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.440
Then why did she...

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.920
She probably offended someone
she shouldn't have.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.510
Mr. Xu?

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.760
Don't ask anymore.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.190
I don't know the details either.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.800
Then who is the woman in the wheelchair?

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.630
Who is she? What does she want?

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.360
I don't know.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.800
Dad, can we leave together?

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.400
Feifei,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.110
don't be afraid.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.510
When Mr. Xu and I
first started our business,

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.840
it was like clearing wasteland.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.760
No matter how hard the rock was,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.577
we had to dig it out
with our bare hands.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.550
Once, a worker had an accident.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.440
The family came to make trouble.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.510
I knelt in front of the memorial,

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.230
and let them curse me, point at me.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.360
I didn't eat or drink
for seventy-two hours straight.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.110
Things are different now.

00:35:48.244 --> 00:35:49.288
You should go overseas.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.230
Lawyer Cao registered a company
in Hong Kong, China,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.670
two years ago.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.440
You're the executive director.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.960
Aren't there plenty of
unresolved issues waiting?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.030
This is the right time
to deal with them.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.280
I'm not asking you to run away.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.670
But these old problems

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.030
are mine

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.110
to face.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.320
The company's future
will bring new challenges.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.480
You'll handle them
in your own younger way.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.400
You'll take the lead.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.440
Feifei.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.510
All your mom

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.800
and I want

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.840
is for you to grow up safely

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.710
and live a safe life.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.320
Do you understand?

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.110
I do.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.840
These are the club's
materials and documents.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:05.480
I didn't know much about

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.066
how the International Club was run.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.840
People called me a vice president.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.550
But actually, I was working for Mr. Xu.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.480
I handled external communications.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.480
The overall management

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.030
was under Mr. Xu's control.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.800
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.400
Mention what?

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.888
The first time we asked you

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.590
about the Penglai Plaza car crash

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.955
involving Wang Dan and Xu Zhiyang.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.000
Why didn't you bring up
the International Club?

00:37:32.111 --> 00:37:33.230
The International Club

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.190
is a side business of our group.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.840
A subsidiary.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.070
You asked about Mr. Xu this time,

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.230
so I mentioned it then.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.670
As a vice president,

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.230
not knowing anything
about the club's operation

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.000
doesn't make much sense, does it?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.070
You're new here?

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.710
Captain Meng,
you should brief your new colleague

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.480
on how things work in Binchuan.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.880
I know Mr. Wu's background.

00:37:59.155 --> 00:38:00.177
He used to be a director

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.280
at the Supply and Marketing Cooperative
in the International Club district.

00:38:03.288 --> 00:38:04.288
I was a deputy director.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.630
Deputy directors usually
handled the real work.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.510
But a deputy is still a deputy.

00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:10.333
There was no room for advancement.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.510
The director had backing.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:13.840
So you resigned.

00:38:14.066 --> 00:38:15.755
Business conditions were good back then,

00:38:15.755 --> 00:38:17.760
and you stayed on working
under Xu Peng ever since.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.760
I'm grateful that Mr. Xu took me in.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.280
I left the civil service

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.000
and still had some connections.

00:38:25.311 --> 00:38:27.466
I worked my way up step by step
to where I am today.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:29.070
It wasn't easy.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.800
Thankfully, Mr. Xu valued me

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.070
and gave me
a department manager position.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.190
To be honest, my main job was

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.190
socializing, eating, drinking,

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.880
and maintaining relationships.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.230
As for the core business,

00:38:45.622 --> 00:38:47.044
if Mr. Xu didn't bring them up,

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.960
I wouldn't dare ask.

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:50.600
You're being modest, Mr. Wu.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.110
The once cooperative director

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.070
is now overseeing the entire group.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.150
Mr. Xu trusted me.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.800
He even let you raise his son.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.360
That kind of trust is rare these days,

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:00.920
Mr. Wu.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.800
Mr. Xu has done me many favors.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.800
But most importantly,

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.150
without him,

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.550
I wouldn't have met my wife.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.960
She used to be a manager
at the International Club as well.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.550
When it comes to making money,

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.377
she was more driven than I was.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.800
I agree that making money

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800
matters.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.000
But what I value more is our family.

00:39:28.201 --> 00:39:29.551
As matters stand,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.710
if Mr. Xu has problems,

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.550
I can't stay clear of them.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.000
If he doesn't,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.510
am I free to go now?

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.070
Please sit, Mr. Wu.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.320
Let me finish first.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.070
I'll make my stand here.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.030
Business comes second.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.440
Running a company these days

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.510
is extremely difficult.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.920
As long as the group
keeps moving forward,

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.230
I'm satisfied.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.400
I also have a suggestion for you two.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.150
There's no need to spend so much
police manpower.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.550
It makes it inconvenient for my daughter
to go out and buy medicine.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.320
Also,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.550
my son-in-law, Xu Zhiyang.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.550
His issue with that woman

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.150
is nothing more
than a relationship dispute.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.960
I want to apply for bail,

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.760
so my family can reunite.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.320
Procedurally,

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.360
I hope you can cut me some slack.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.510
Su Min,

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.440
stay and have a meal with us later.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.960
Go Feng should be back soon.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.510
Have some tea first.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.510
I'll go cook.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.822
Madam Zhang, don't trouble yourself.
We can't stay long.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.110
I just wanted to talk with you.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.840
Young lady, find a seat.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.800
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.150
How's your leg recovering?

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.920
Does it still hurt?

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.510
Much better.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.400
It wasn't a serious injury.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.190
Still, injuries take time to heal.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.630
Be careful

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.590
not to catch a cold.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.920
Su Min, you came for something specific,
didn't you?

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.510
Well, I wanted to ask about something.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.960
Before Mr. Gao ran the food stall,

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.480
did he work anywhere else?

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.400
Quite a few places.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.630
Most of the well-known restaurants
in the city.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.880
He worked at many of them
for a while.

00:41:27.911 --> 00:41:29.110
Do you remember which ones?

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.230
I don't

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.760
really remember.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.960
Many of those restaurants

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.110
either shut down or changed names.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.320
The International Club.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.670
Does that ring a bell?

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.320
Well.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.590
About the Penglai Plaza car crash,

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.960
all the leads now point
to the International Club.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.400
We found

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.150
part of the club's employee
contact list.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.710
Mr. Gao's name

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.960
is on it.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.670
According to the records,
he started working there

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.000
in 1991.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.000
We believe

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.360
Mr. Gao and Gao Feng's biological mother

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.030
were very likely working there
during the same period.

00:42:16.488 --> 00:42:17.590
Did you know about this?

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.320
Of course.

00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:22.670
That was back in the 1990s.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.280
The club had a lot of employees then.

00:42:24.377 --> 00:42:26.177
They may not all have known each other.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.110
But the case is very complicated.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.320
I want to know,

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.880
have you met
Gao Feng's biological mother before?
