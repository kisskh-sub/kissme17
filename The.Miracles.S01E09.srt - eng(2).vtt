00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.539
As the world order was shifting,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.420
in Shenzhen on the South China Sea coast,

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.780
undercurrents of change were quietly surging.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.700
Stocks became the hot topic everywhere.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.019
Long queues snaked outside securities firms.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.659
Unofficial stock trading spots were packed.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.060
In this near-feverish atmosphere,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.700
people scrambled to catch

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.900
the "get-rich-quick" train.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.459
Stay away from illegal trading.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.780
Invest rationally.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.340
Stay away from illegal trading.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:20.980
Invest rationally.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.299
Hurry, hurry!

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.180
Fifty yuan a share!

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.060
Any left?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.939
Don't cut in line!

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:37.980
Yeah, first come, first served.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.219
My friend works inside.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.459
I'm here to see him on business.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.420
Get in line.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.579
Which one? Which one to buy?

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:48.459
There are no stocks for sale now.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.459
Everyone, stop pushing.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:50.379
And stop shouting.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:58.379
Manager Wang.

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:59.219
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.540
No, no, I just arrived too.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.579
It's just that so many people

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.819
have been queuing since midnight,

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.219
and still can't buy stocks.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.659
You see.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:06.900
Here.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.379
Let's sit down first.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:09.659
We can talk slowly.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:11.300
Well then,

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.780
I'll get straight to the point.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.379
Good.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.780
This is Shenzhujian.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.340
Yesterday's listed price at the firm:

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.419
Two yuan twenty per share.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.939
This one is the black market's

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.580
actual transaction price yesterday:

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.300
Ten yuan eighty.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.939
The black market is almost five times our firm's price.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.939
It's an absolute mess.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.020
It should have been cleaned up long ago.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.860
I've heard

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.659
some people even bought fake stocks.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.620
So the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's unified trading

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.180
is absolutely not optional.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.300
If this chaos continues,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.219
there will be trouble sooner or later.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.099
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:41.379
It's urgent.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.500
Extremely urgent.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.460
This is Director Yu,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.020
who led our preparatory team,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.099
working tirelessly for two years,

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.460
to draft these regulations.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.659
You can take a look.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.939
Please tell Director Yu,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.580
unity is strength.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.099
We will fully cooperate.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:57.819
Thank you.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.139
Wait a moment, please.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:02.939
Sorry about that.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:06.460
What are you doing?

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.939
Bringing you coffee.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:09.900
Who drinks coffee?

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.099
Trying to be fancy.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:12.379
Change it to tea.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:13.259
In my place,

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.539
we follow my rules.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.659
I can't find the tea leaves.

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.939
What are you good for?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.780
Wait, I'll go find some.

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:25.659
What are you doing here?

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.060
Can't I come?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.780
It's a small world.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.659
The coffee is just in time.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.020
I actually am a bit sleepy.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.259
Can you see how tired I am?

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.659
I've been pulling all-nighters for days.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.900
What's it to you?

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.860
Here, let me through.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.620
Brother Junsheng!

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.340
Brother Junsheng! Brother Junsheng!

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.020
Finally found you!

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.580
A Jie.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.699
Sister Liang Ying is here too.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.819
Here to buy stocks, or...

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:53.699
here for a date?

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.099
I'll smack your mouth.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.379
I'm here on official business.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.379
What are you doing here?

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:58.139
Don't you have to work?

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:58.979
I'm on my day off.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.340
Brother Junsheng,

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:01.539
I came first thing this morning,

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:02.340
but couldn't buy any at all.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.060
Help me out.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.099
Look at this crowd. Who came later than you?

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.740
I came earlier than them!

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.099
Didn't I also fail to buy any?

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:09.740
Alright, alright. Wait a bit.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.659
I'll figure something out for you later.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.539
Let's go.

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:14.139
Going.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:14.819
Here's your umbrella.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:15.379
Don't need it.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.100
By the way, Junsheng,

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:18.139
tell A Jie

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:18.980
to stay away from the black market.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.899
I know.

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:24.899
Tell me, this Shenzhen Stock Exchange...

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.100
Is it an exchange,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.620
or a securities market?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.660
Keeps changing its name every other day.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.740
Gives me a headache just hearing it.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:34.620
If they want to get it done,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.139
who knows when that'll be.

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:40.579
What are you doing?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.060
I'm not talking to you anymore.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.579
Bye.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.500
Wait.

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:47.339
Throw this away too.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.300
Throw it.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.379
Little brat.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.180
Lecturing me with a bunch of principles.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.100
Makes no sense.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:00.779
Director.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.300
I'm back.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.100
I delivered all the booklets.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.500
What was their attitude?

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.100
I think everyone is very supportive

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.459
and willing to cooperate.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:10.740
Really that smooth?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.139
Have a little faith.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.139
Xiao Liang.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.779
If we truly achieve great success,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.180
you will have contributed greatly.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:19.579
Not at all.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.259
Look at you.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.019
Your eyes are red from overwork.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.579
The wind is picking up.

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:36.019
Remember this.

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:37.819
You need to enter the right door, find the right person.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:38.819
And worship the right god.

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:40.139
Brother, have a cigarette.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:40.899
No, no thanks.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:42.060
Brother Junsheng.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.860
I've already been to

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.819
over a dozen trading halls.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.860
I just can't buy any.

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:46.220
It's just starting to get hot.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.100
Why fight for scraps there?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.220
Find Brother Wu. It's a sure thing.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.459
Whoever pays first gets the stock.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:51.019
Brother Junsheng.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.139
You have wide connections.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.939
Introduce me to that Brother Wu.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.339
Why do you want to know him?

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.019
I need money urgently.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.339
You borrowed money?

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:03.939
Your mom worked so hard,

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:05.699
running a rice noodle shop to put you through school.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.579
Was it easy asking favors to get you a job?

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:07.300
I just don't want to see

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.660
my mom struggle every single day.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.540
My mom struggles every single day.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:09.779
That's why I'm doing this.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.540
Now everyone says there's an opportunity.

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:12.579
I want to take a gamble too.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:13.699
What if it doesn't work out?

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.579
They can all succeed.

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:15.660
Am I the only one who can't?

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:17.819
Bro, we've been friends since we were kids.

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:18.779
Consider this me begging you.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:20.259
Help your little brother one more time.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:21.379
To be honest with you,

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:23.339
I've already bought some fake stocks.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:25.100
My entire life savings are on the line, bro.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:28.540
What are you doing?

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.339
Come back with me.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.459
I can't go back, bro.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:33.779
Bro, I'm begging you.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.339
Just treat this dead horse of mine

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.660
as a live one to cure one more time.

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:50.300
Please.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:58.939
No moves left.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:00.579
Hindsight is 20/20.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:01.699
It has to be Brother Wu.

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:02.579
Brother Wu.

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:06.899
Manager Junsheng.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:07.939
Long time no see.

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:08.980
Long time no see. Come, play a game. Play a game.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:10.339
Sit, sit, sit.

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:10.980
Come on, come on.

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:11.899
Brother Wu.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.899
This is my brother, A Jie.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:13.579
My childhood friend.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:17.579
A small token of respect.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.139
Is this an offering for incense?

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.699
Or an apprenticeship fee?

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.660
Don't joke with me.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.379
Of course it's the apprenticeship fee.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.019
Please look after A Jie from now on.

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:31.899
Yes, Brother Wu.

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:32.740
We'll get rich following you.

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:33.939
Manager Junsheng.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:36.259
I've heard all about it.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.699
The people from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.259
have already come knocking on your door.

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:40.660
You're from the trading hall.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:43.300
If even you can't help him get rich,

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:45.540
what use is coming to me?

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:47.660
What kind of manager am I?

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.899
At our place,

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:50.819
only Manager Wang has the final say.

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:53.139
But for the trading here,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.180
everyone knows

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:56.899
Brother Wu alone calls the shots.

00:07:57.259 --> 00:07:57.899
Brother Wu, Brother Wu.

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.180
So, what does Manager Wang

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.180
think of this Shenzhen Stock Exchange now?

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:09.339
Move the cannon.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.819
Those people

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:12.579
who studied abroad,

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:14.259
can't seriously think that

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:15.579
setting up an exchange,

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:17.459
getting a few rusty metal machines,

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:18.939
ringing a golden bell,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.139
making it just like abroad,

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:22.899
means this thing will succeed, right?

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:28.060
Our line of work

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:29.459
belongs to metal.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.620
Metal needs flow, energy.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:33.620
Wealth needs to gather people.

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:35.379
Look at our place here.

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:36.220
Look.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.580
Such vibrant energy.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.259
Watch closely.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.100
Can they compare to us?

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:41.620
Yes, yes, yes.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.379
Brother Wu, Brother Wu.

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:54.340
This business deal,

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:56.820
it's not done yet.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.379
First, remember one saying.

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:03.139
If you gamble, be ready to lose.

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:06.100
Cheers.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:06.340
Here, Brother Junsheng.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.899
Here, Brother Junsheng.

00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:07.460
Cheers.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.259
Cheers.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.580
Auntie, the food is here.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.659
Come on, come on.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.259
Mom, take a break.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.460
There's enough food, Auntie.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.379
Sit down and rest a while.

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:15.580
I'm not tired.

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:17.139
I'm happy you guys came.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.700
My son only has you few good friends.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.659
With you guys helping him,

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:21.899
I feel much more at ease.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.059
Look, these bowls and chopsticks,

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:25.419
and that stove,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.179
were all newly bought by him for me.

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:28.500
Boss, one order of rice noodle rolls.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.259
He made money.

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:31.019
Just a moment.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:32.379
No, Mom, let me do it.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.899
No need.

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:37.500
Relying on this small business

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.659
will take forever

00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:39.539
to make any money.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.019
From now on,

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:42.820
I'm sticking with Brother Junsheng.

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:43.740
Here, brother.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:46.059
Junsheng's workplace forbids trading stocks.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.379
That's because you don't know,

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.820
Brother Junsheng has plenty of connections.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.539
Here, A Jie.

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:50.860
This fish is delicious.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.500
Come on, come on.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.860
Taste the fish your mom made.

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:54.299
Eat the fish.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.500
Talk less. Here.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.539
It's really tasty.

00:09:57.659 --> 00:09:58.620
Did you take him there?

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:00.019
No.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.139
Go where?

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:02.500
No.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.340
Tell me.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.059
Did he take you to the black market?

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.220
What did I tell you guys?

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.740
You see others making money,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.460
but let me tell you,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.100
that is a huge pit, a trap.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.899
We go way back.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.019
How could I possibly trick you?

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:22.179
Otherwise, why do you think I've been

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:23.379
working so hard on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:24.220
for the past two years?

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:25.740
Don't I know

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.779
what you're doing it for?

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:29.539
I just took him for a look around.

00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:30.620
What's the big deal?

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.340
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.419
Just to broaden my horizons.

00:10:32.419 --> 00:10:33.899
Right, just a casual look around.

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:37.179
Why do you have this?

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:41.059
I... I was just studying it.

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:50.820
You and your big mouth.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.379
You, you...

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:52.460
You blab about everything.

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:55.139
Why did Liang Ying leave?

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.779
Go after her, quick!

00:10:58.139 --> 00:10:58.820
Such a good girl,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.940
where will you find another like her?

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:00.779
Go, hurry!

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.500
Yeah, yeah, Brother, go quickly.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.779
Wait a minute, wait!

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:07.620
Listen to my explanation.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.379
Mom.

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:13.860
Director Yu, look.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.899
Someone wrote another article saying

00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:16.259
our Shenzhen Stock Exchange has shallow roots

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:16.980
and won't succeed.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.500
Do you think we should wait a bit?

00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:19.779
There are also people spreading rumors

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:21.139
claiming they have inside information

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:22.259
that the Central Government didn't approve it.

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:23.940
How is our preparatory group supposed to work?

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.940
Establishing the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:26.539
is beneficial for the common people.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.179
The Central Government definitely supports it.

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:30.500
We can't wait any longer.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:31.860
Have you guys heard?

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.899
"East Development" in the black market

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:36.379
has already shot up to 160.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.860
While the listed price at the securities office

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:40.139
is 80.

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:41.299
What will happen in the future,

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:42.259
no one knows.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.179
Investors' information is monopolized,

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:45.539
yet they are still rushing in.

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:47.299
One share becomes ten shares!

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:49.860
Brother Wu.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.779
A Jie, A Jie.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.379
Manager Junsheng's brother.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:54.899
Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:56.539
Come, come.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.740
Ten thousand.

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:01.620
Ten thousand.

00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:02.779
Take a look.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:04.740
So much.

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:09.899
Buying now

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:11.059
is the right move.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.019
You think 160 is expensive, right?

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:14.740
I'm telling you,

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:16.779
it will rise, rise big.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.740
In a few days,

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:19.179
it'll be too late for regrets.

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:20.700
Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:22.259
We'll listen to Brother Wu.

00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:24.379
Here is your stock.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:26.379
Thanks.

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:27.179
Good luck.

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:28.019
Brother Wu.

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:28.659
Thanks.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.100
East Development.

00:12:30.299 --> 00:12:32.980
80, 160, 240.

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:33.980
They are numbers.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.059
But behind these numbers

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.059
are the life savings of so many families.

00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:39.779
If black market speculators here

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:41.019
and people from the securities office

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:41.899
collude with each other,

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:44.059
it could very likely lead to serious consequences.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.059
Did you hear the news?

00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:54.539
People are dumping East Development at 90 in the black market.

00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:56.019
90?

00:12:57.379 --> 00:12:58.899
I bought it at 160!

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:00.379
I didn't even sell at 240!

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:03.379
Didn't they say it would go to 300?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.019
How can you trust those scalpers?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.379
Who knows if they have inside information?

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:10.500
And it was those scalpers who started dumping first.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:12.179
Now no one dares to buy in.

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:13.659
Are you guys selling?

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:15.019
Are you selling?

00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:17.379
If it's 80, so be it.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.100
I'm telling you, we can't wait anymore.

00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:21.700
We have to cut our losses and sell.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.539
If we don't sell now, we'll lose everything.

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:24.779
Are you selling?

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:26.259
Sell it for me.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.539
I'm selling, I'm selling!

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.500
I'm selling!

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:39.220
I-I'm selling it all!

00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:40.379
Over here, this way!

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:41.500
Let's talk, let's talk.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.740
I can give you eighty-five now.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.899
More than any of them.

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:46.860
No problem.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:48.500
If you wait any longer, you'll miss your chance.

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:51.340
Suppose someone at the securities firm leaks

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.019
the news about Dong Fazhan's stock split

00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:54.740
to the black market speculators in advance.

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:56.379
Then they go and spread

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:58.179
the false rumor that the bank will

00:13:58.179 --> 00:13:59.139
suppress the stock price.

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:00.059
They create panic,

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.899
luring retail investors to sell low.

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:03.259
They'll buy up huge amounts of shares.

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:09.539
Once the real split news is announced,

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:10.899
one share becomes ten,

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:12.139
by that time,

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:13.659
even more people will be buying.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.940
Dong Fazhan is splitting!

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.539
One share splits into ten!

00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:19.419
It went from eighty to two-sixty!

00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:20.779
It tripled!

00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:22.139
Thank goodness I didn't sell.

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:22.820
Heaven be praised.

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:24.379
I'm rich! I'm rich!

00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:25.980
This time I can turn my luck around!

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.580
Darn it.

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:27.779
I've lost everything.

00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:29.419
If only I'd waited one more day...

00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:31.659
One more day would've made all the difference.

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:34.659
Who still has Dong Fazhan shares?

00:14:34.659 --> 00:14:35.860
Give them to me, I'll take them all!

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.220
After completing their arbitrage,

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:46.980
the person with the insider information

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.820
will split the profits with these speculators.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.899
And the investors kept in the dark

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:52.139
can only be slaughtered.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.259
Two-sixty! Two-sixty!

00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:02.419
If I'd just waited a few more days, I'd be rich!

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.220
I'd be rich!

00:15:05.299 --> 00:15:07.059
I could have been rich.

00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:09.899
If we don't implement unified management soon,

00:15:10.179 --> 00:15:11.740
investors will suffer huge losses.

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:12.659
But right now, we...

00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:13.500
No more "buts"!

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.019
Rules are forged by action,

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:16.019
not by waiting.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.980
Everyone, lift your heads!

00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:18.259
From this moment on,

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:19.139
every single one of us

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:21.620
must show the determination to open the exchange!

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:22.899
We can't wait for dawn.

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:24.019
If dawn doesn't come,

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.940
we must light the lamps ourselves.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.659
What are you doing squatting here?

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:43.779
Bro.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.019
Here.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.539
Made money that fast?

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:56.179
Following Brother Wu,

00:15:56.899 --> 00:15:58.779
catching Dong Fazhan's split and surge,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.539
you made money, right?

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.139
No rush to pay me back.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.500
I'm not a stingy guy.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.179
No, bro...

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.820
Thanks, bro.

00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:06.940
Here, the principal and interest are all in there.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:09.539
You made quite a bit, huh?

00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:12.139
Did I ask you for interest?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.500
Don't be so formal with me.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.059
Come on, let's go drink and celebrate!

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.179
Bro, bro...

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.419
I... I...

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.500
I've got things to do.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.179
You okay?

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.659
I'm fine.

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:27.779
I'm off.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.500
Oh, right, bro.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.779
Go see my mom when you have time.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.659
She really misses you.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.259
Obviously! You don't have to tell me.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.899
Your mom is my mom too.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.940
I'll go see her tomorrow.

00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:43.899
Alright then.

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:45.659
See you.
