00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:26.420
=Manbo Destiny=

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.060
=Episode 4=

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:51.850
The Second Princess did very well.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.639
First Princess.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.879
It is your turn.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.439
Your hand.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.719
Higher!

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.599
What are you doing?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.737
Why did you hit me again?

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.279
The First Princess did not do well.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.639
You deserve to be punished.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.737
I have walked back and forth
no fewer than ten times.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.637
Every time you find an excuse to hit me.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.159
Try hitting me one more time.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.700
Miss Maka did the right thing.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.919
If it is not corrected now,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.799
at the wedding,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.599
losing face for you
would be a minor matter.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.639
The First Prince represents
the entire royal family.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.862
Where are you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.679
supposed to put his dignity then?

00:02:03.237 --> 00:02:03.925
You...

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.300
If you want to stay in the royal family,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.159
you must follow the royal

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:09.919
rules.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.100
Since Miss Maka mentioned rules,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.000
then let us talk about them.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.119
Miss Maka is the first one
who broke the rules.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.759
The Second Princess is speaking to me.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.510
Why are you interrupting?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.862
How dare you.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.599
She is the Queen's
principal lady in waiting.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.159
How dare you strike her.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.079
Are you disregarding the Queen?

00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:39.479
The Second Princess is right.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.479
Miss Maka dared to strike a princess.

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:47.125
Is she disregarding the First Prince,

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:49.434
or disregarding the royal family?

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.725
First Princess.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.987
I was wrong.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.439
Such a sharp tongue.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.000
You are nothing
more than Song Pai's tool.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.230
Do you really think
he wants to marry you?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.812
Since you say I am Song Pai's tool,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.025
then Second Princess,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.639
whose tool are you?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.199
Alright.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.837
I have practiced enough too.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.862
I will head back first.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.919
Stop right there.

00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:22.762
What do you want?

00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:23.800
Want to fight?

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:27.672
I suggest you be more careful.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.712
This royal family is not somewhere
you can stay just because you want to.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.639
Besides,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.519
Song Pai is not what you imagine.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.399
Do not fantasize

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.319
that he can be used by you.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.039
Whether I can stay

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.072
depends on my mood.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.390
What does it have to do
with the Second Princess?

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.919
Also,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.100
the Second Princess
keeps bringing up Song Pai.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.812
Why?

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.500
Are you trying to rekindle old feelings?

00:03:58.212 --> 00:03:59.412
Sorry,

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:01.036
that is already impossible.

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:01.937
He

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.239
is mine now.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.950
You...

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:15.187
Remember this.

00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:16.737
I,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.962
Guan Mengmeng,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.750
am not someone to mess with.

00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:20.637
Hmph.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.250
Guan Mengmeng.

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:32.797
Guan Mengmeng.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.799
Guan Mengmeng.

00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:34.537
Hey.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.159
First Prince and Second Prince arrive.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.219
(Wow.)

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.262
(That acting would be wasted)

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.700
(if you did not become an actress.)

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.239
Why did you hit me?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.825
Mengmeng.

00:04:57.912 --> 00:04:58.549
Mengmeng.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.079
Get up first.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.275
I have already been trying
very hard to learn.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.359
Why do you still have to hit me?

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.359
Wen Shanna.

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:13.325
Out of respect for you
as Lin Ge's princess,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.830
I have tolerated you again and again.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.590
But today you actually
dared to threaten Mengmeng.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.700
I did not.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.000
It was clearly her.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.975
Song Pai.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.479
We had no idea what happened just now.

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:25.775
Maybe

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:27.574
Guan Mengmeng staged it herself.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.725
Lin Ge.

00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:30.087
Do not blame them.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.587
It really is because I am stupid.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.359
I learn too slowly.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.400
Lin Ge.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.500
You should show more respect
to your sister in law.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.599
She is such a fragile woman.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.439
Yet she is already crying like this now.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.279
Do not cry anymore, Mengmeng.

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:51.336
Your Highness.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.359
She is not gentle at all.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.599
Just now,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.719
she even struck me hard.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.719
She hit you?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.919
Yes, Your Highness.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.839
Then you must have done
something utterly unforgivable.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.425
To actually provoke my gentle princess.

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:11.725
Speak.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.839
What exactly did you do?

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.725
Your Highness, please spare us.

00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:16.862
We

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.337
will never dare again.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.862
Baofan.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.399
Here.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.100
Drag them away.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.750
Punish them severely.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.399
Yes.

00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:23.187
No.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.759
Wait.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.850
She belongs to the Queen.

00:06:27.112 --> 00:06:28.612
She is the Queen's person.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.137
Then whose person are you?

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:31.787
She

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.479
is my person now.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.062
Then keep your people in line.

00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:43.744
Do not be afraid. Let us go.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.119
Guan Mengmeng.

00:07:04.062 --> 00:07:05.325
My noble Miss Guan,

00:07:06.262 --> 00:07:08.104
how long do you plan to let me hold you?

00:07:09.975 --> 00:07:12.362
Is the First Prince really that weak?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.130
You cannot even handle this short walk?

00:07:18.787 --> 00:07:19.612
Stop pretending.

00:07:20.487 --> 00:07:22.625
Anyone could tell you
were fake crying just now.

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:25.325
You saw through it long ago.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.919
If anyone tries to make things hard
for you again,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.440
remember to come find me.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.500
That will not be necessary.

00:07:30.873 --> 00:07:32.120
I can beat anyone,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.199
anywhere, on my own.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.239
Hmph.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.759
They really hit you?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.319
Why else would I go after them?

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.800
What are you doing now?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.450
Let go of me.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:56.687
It is not what you think.

00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:57.825
You are just like Song Pai,

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:00.000
trusting a foreign woman
instead of me, is that it?

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.370
You still have the nerve to say that.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.759
You cannot even beat a foreign woman.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.890
Do you know how embarrassing
that is for me?

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.719
It is all because that Guan Mengmeng
is too scheming.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.519
Come here.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.279
Do not move.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.999
Does it still hurt?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It does not hurt anymore.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.599
I told you not to move.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.750
Here. I will apply some medicine
near your ear too.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.279
I will do this part myself.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.999
You cannot see it.
How would you apply it?

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.319
Ah.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.435
Why are you suddenly being so kind?

00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:12.087
No.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.200
You are injured. It is normal
for me to apply medicine for you.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.810
Besides, I am worried you
will be left with a scar.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.000
Then you might back out
of the contract again.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.599
You can rest assured.

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:24.891
We are only
in a contractual relationship.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.512
Once the three months are up,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.789
I will take my money

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.119
and leave far away.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.279
Then you should apply it yourself.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.519
So strange.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.225
Do you want some?

00:10:16.437 --> 00:10:17.562
No.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.599
Do not worry.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.112
This is our little secret.

00:10:22.162 --> 00:10:23.521
I will not tell anyone.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.359
Alright?

00:10:24.612 --> 00:10:25.224
Come.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.147
Pinky swear.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.087
This is for you.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.919
Our little Princess Wanida,
you're so adorable.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.519
Unlike your eldest and second brothers,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.039
who fight each other
all day to the death.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.239
Second Brother
really likes Eldest Brother.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.039
Ah?

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.519
Wanida.

00:10:50.137 --> 00:10:51.425
So you are here, Wanida.

00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:54.000
Second Brother
really likes Eldest Brother.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.159
What did you say?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.525
Where did you run off to?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.839
You gave Mother such a fright.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.719
Little Princess Wanida

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.375
just wanted to share some food with me.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.279
Please do not scold her.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.999
For the First Princess's sake,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.159
let this one go.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.912
Hurry and thank the First Princess.

00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:14.079
Let us go.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.080
Thank you, First Princess.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.200
Bye bye, First Princess.

00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:18.662
Goodbye, First Princess.

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:19.431
Bye bye.

00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:20.075
Goodbye.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.279
Lin Ge

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.089
really likes Song Pai?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.599
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.759
Your Majesty.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.250
I

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.879
returned yesterday
from the southern disaster area.

00:11:42.637 --> 00:11:43.925
The southern disaster area

00:11:43.987 --> 00:11:45.239
has suffered severe devastation.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.462
The people

00:11:46.862 --> 00:11:48.407
have been displaced.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.359
You two princes,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.399
regarding disaster relief,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.919
what are your views?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.759
Father,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.879
I wish to request permission

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.439
to actively develop
cross border e-commerce,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.519
to bring greater benefits to our people.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.879
Your Majesty,

00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.361
I object.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.679
For so many years, we have
handled disaster relief ourselves

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.639
and remained self sufficient.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.239
Yet the people are still suffering.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.079
If we cling to outdated ideas,

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.119
how can our nation grow strong?

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.650
Father,

00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:27.262
I also disagree.

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:30.279
Our people are hardworking
and independent.

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:31.500
With the support of the state,

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.110
they will surely overcome this hardship.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.519
But if we rely only on
royal relief as in previous years,

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.839
how many more will be left displaced?

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.337
Guan Mengmeng

00:12:54.387 --> 00:12:56.300
is not the daughter of Huasheng Group,

00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:59.159
but an orphan with no one to rely on.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.375
What?

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.999
Outrageous.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.000
She dared to deceive
the Manbo royal family.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.399
Pass down my order.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.362
Arrest Guan Mengmeng immediately.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.039
Yes.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.839
(Guan Mengmeng)

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.439
(fabricating her identity,)

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.039
(and deceiving the royal family.)

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.879
(I will see
where you can run this time.)

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.439
(Oh no.)

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.319
(My identity was exposed so quickly.)

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.279
(I must get through this first,)

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.239
(then discuss countermeasures
with Song Pai.)

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.199
(You cannot see me,)

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.559
(you cannot see me.)

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.359
(Great,)

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.799
(I was not discovered.)

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.079
Hi.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.959
What a coincidence.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.959
Guards.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.759
Do not shout.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.159
I am warning you.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.719
My gun has no eyes.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.750
Watch your mouth.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.079
Otherwise,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.719
I will not spare you.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.719
Guan Mengmeng.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.439
You dared to play me.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.119
Guards!

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.599
Seize her.
