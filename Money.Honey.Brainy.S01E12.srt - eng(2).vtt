WEBVTT

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:38.840
Today we're slashing the price

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.479
to the bottom.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.359
Today we've been invited to

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.479
the headquarters of Lin's Desserts.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.000
As you can see on both sides,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.880
it's filled with little cakes.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.320
Lin's Desserts

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.640
has always been a leader in the industry.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.840
Take a look at this one,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.840
the most classic black and white chocolate mousse.

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:57.759
I never expected

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:59.119
Wen Pei'an to actually convince

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.600
Galileo to sign Qixing.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.119
It seems

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.799
he really still likes Qixing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.799
Getting Qixing signed to the company

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.120
must have made her very happy.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.640
I must find a chance to tell her

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.519
that I am the Four Seas President she dislikes.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920
Whether she can accept it or not,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.519
I must take this step.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.879
A layer of pure, sweet white chocolate mousse,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.400
and at the very bottom is moist, dense chocolate cake.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.799
Her eyes

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.319
seem to reveal a hint of sadness.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.959
There are so many little cakes today.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.680
Too bad we can't eat any.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.439
What's wrong,

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.920
Qixing?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.359
Are you okay?

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.879
Ou Lu is acting so intensely,

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.920
he must be covering for me.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.079
Still pretending to be reserved.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.920
Clearly cares about Qixing too.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:51.599
Does your hand hurt?

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.239
Truly my good brother of eight years.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.079
This sibling bond

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.000
is clearly very deep.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.280
I can't see

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.760
any rich family feud here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.039
Otherwise,

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.360
let's go to the hospital first.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.159
Today's shoot can be canceled.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.639
It's fine, just a minor injury.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.560
Don't delay the shoot.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.199
No.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.639
No.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.159
What if it's a hairline fracture?

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.639
Ou Lu seems to be overacting a bit.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400
But that's normal.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.240
This bastard

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.039
never had any acting skills to speak of.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.360
The bond where blood is thicker than water

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.000
can only be seen in times of crisis, right?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.719
A hairline fracture

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.840
is very serious.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.759
It's okay.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.319
Don't make a fuss.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.280
Director, let's continue.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.000
Another take.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.360
That's right.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.280
Qixing has already signed with Four Seas.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.960
Then I need to hurry up

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.599
and help her win over Wen Pei'an.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:47.639
Well then,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.080
let's continue shooting.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.680
Okay.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.479
Come on, keep going, keep going!

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.120
Come on, come on.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120
Let's get to work, get to work!

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.199
Ready.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:55.199
Three.

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.000
Two.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.400
One.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.120
Action!

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.280
Today in my livestream,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.120
not ninety-eight,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.800
not eighty-eight,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.080
only sixty-eight!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.960
The sunshine is really nice today.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.240
Yes.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.719
Every single plant and tree here

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.240
I know like the back of my hand.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.520
I remember this place used to be a

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.840
children's welfare home.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.759
I grew up right here.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:26.879
But I never thought

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.360
we'd be filming here today.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.719
If she knew I chose this place,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.400
she'd surely be very moved.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.080
To confess to you,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.879
I did my homework thoroughly.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.039
With so many beautiful spots to choose from,

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.120
you insisted on coming here.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.840
The filming results

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.240
will definitely suffer.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.319
You know,

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.639
when I was little,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.639
I often painted in this spot.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.719
All around

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.039
were flowers.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.879
I didn't expect

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.120
that today, this place would also

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.360
be completely filled with flowers.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.720
How could I take action

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.279
without doing any research?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.040
These flowers will be thrown away

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.920
after the shoot. What a waste.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.639
We'll sell them online later.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.680
We can even make some money.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.480
The atmosphere is right now.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.560
The timing is also quite ripe.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.560
I should be able to tell her.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:43.600
Do you know

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.759
what that pot of flowers

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.959
is called?

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.439
That's not too hard for me.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.600
In ancient Greek mythology,

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.000
Adonis

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.360
was the beloved youth

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.560
of Aphrodite,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.759
the goddess of love and beauty.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.480
During a hunt,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.000
he was fatally wounded by a boar.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.800
Aphrodite's

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.839
tears and

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:05.720
his blood

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.079
turned into this flower.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:09.279
Thus, this flower symbolizes

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:10.600
beauty

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:11.720
and love.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.000
Pivoine.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.639
Isn't this just a peony?

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.519
"Pivoine"?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.959
I think

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.120
she must be fascinated by me.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.519
Xin Tong,

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.920
there's something I want to tell you.

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:28.639
Actually...

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.079
I know.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.879
You know?

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:31.879
Of course I know.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.959
When did you find out?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.040
I've known for a long time.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.920
So you've known all along?

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.759
I've long known

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.160
that you still like Qixing

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:46.920
and want me to put in a good word for you.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.879
The reason you could convince that bastard

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:51.959
to cooperate this time

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.120
is because

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.839
you still have her in your heart.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:54.319
I'm just...

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.040
You're just putting on a brave face.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.399
Of your entire body,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.000
it's only your mouth

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:00.680
that's

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.199
the hardest.

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.199
What I wanted to say was...

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.000
Wrap!

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.319
We're done!

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:06.040
I'm just a little...

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.199
Does it still hurt?

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.759
It hurts.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.480
This sibling relationship

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.839
is way better than I imagined.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.800
What's going on here?

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:24.720
Then blow on it for me, and it won't hurt.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.800
Aren't the two of them overacting a bit?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.360
It feels so good to have family.

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:33.560
Is that enough?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.519
Not enough.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.079
Help me properly ease the pain tonight at home.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.360
What are those two acting out?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.480
Their sibling affection is so good

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.720
it's a bit over the top, isn't it?

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.199
Qixing's finger

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.279
shouldn't have any major issues.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.079
Everyone,

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:57.639
good work today.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.959
You...

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.360
don't have anything you want to say to Qixing?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.040
You look very beautiful today.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.000
Thank you for the compliment.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.000
Today's confession plan:

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.319
Failure.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.600
Although Wen Pei'an

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.680
is still a bit reserved,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.439
there's still progress.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:26.959
Happy.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.160
Wrap.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.920
Today's shoot went smoothly.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.040
We wrapped up so early.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.560
How about

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.279
we all have dinner together?

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:40.759
I'll pass.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.920
I'm watching my weight.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.040
You all eat more.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.439
I have something to attend to later,

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:49.720
so I won't join you for dinner.

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.600
Why are you always

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.199
so rude to him?

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.560
I'm hungry.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.800
Let's go eat.

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.199
With just you,

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:07.199
you'll never be able to win over our Qixing.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.079
Couples'

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.279
set meal.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:22.839
This shop offers a 40% discount today

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.279
if you post on Little Blue Book.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.480
Why must we order the set meal?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.639
Can't we order a la carte?

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.199
A la carte is so expensive.

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:30.399
Why don't you ever think

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.800
about the company?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.720
I haven't asked you yet.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.960
How did you convince Galileo

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.120
to sign Qixing?

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.399
Galileo...

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:39.879
He really...

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.480
It's not what you think.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.240
He didn't say anything.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.559
He just...

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.120
agreed.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.240
That simple?

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:50.240
Just that simple.

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:53.240
I just told him

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.360
my own thoughts.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.720
Do you think there might be

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.320
some kind of trap in this?

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.320
Should I tell Qixing?

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.960
Suit yourself.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.159
Qixing got hurt today.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.240
You were very nervous.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.679
I could tell.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:10.799
What about you?

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:12.279
You still can't let go of

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:14.039
the feelings between the two of you.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.759
Don't say anything.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
I understand.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.679
I don't want to talk about her.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.360
Look at you.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.120
You should learn to face your own heart.

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:28.480
Avoidance

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.000
won't solve any problems.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.320
What you should do

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.039
is to boldly express

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.080
your love to the other person.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.159
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.559
You're not going to eat me, are you?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.840
Don't worry

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.519
Tomorrow

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:01.799
I'll help you arrange a meeting with Qixing

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.559
Let's talk, no need for knives

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.159
Be careful, or I'll call the police
