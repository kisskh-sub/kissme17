Haven't you been yelled at enough
by Mr. Xu?

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.039
We're not even in Binchuan yet.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.879
Even if you sing in Zhuhai,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.000
it'll still reach his ears.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.479
Nonsense.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.639
Saying sing too much and you lose value.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.159
The one with value

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.240
is me.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.520
Enough. Stop it.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.360
I sent you out to work,
yet you let yourself loose.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.919
Stop being smug.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.680
Are you done yet?

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.280
Fine.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.879
We're back.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.120

We'll arrive on the 18th
and go back on the 20th.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.900
We have to meet a boss there.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.280
Wu wants both of us to go along.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.400
The 18th won't work.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.150
Mr. Liu is bringing
an important guest over.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.439
Tell him to change the date.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.720
Tell Mr. Liu to change the date?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.680
Can't you do it?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.590
Are you assistant team leader
for nothing?

Is it over there?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.500
Someone's trying to lie on the tracks.

We're already late.

Don't meddle.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.180
Stop acting crazy.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.160
You all drove me crazy long ago.

- Don't do anything stupid.
- Help.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.399
- Get up.
- The train's coming.

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.360

Someone's lying on the tracks.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.959
Get up.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.439

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.279
- Young man.
- Young man.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.160
Think it through.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.600
You've got a long road ahead.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.720
Get up.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.360
Lie down somewhere else.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.240
Yeah.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.879
Don't do anything stupid.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.600
Get up. It's dangerous there.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.720
Get up!

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.480
Get up!

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.040
Get up, young man.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.480
What are you doing?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.879
Get up.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.319
Wake up!

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.439
Get up here!

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.160
Let's go. Leave it.

Wu brought this back
from Hong Kong, China.

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.439
It's yours.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:52.399
Is this thing real or fake?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.639
What orders do you have, Ms. Hong?

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.319
Mr. Wang is going fishing this Saturday

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:04.160
and wants you along.

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:06.360
Sure.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.480
If Ms. Hong says so,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.680
how could I refuse?

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:12.480
He's important.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.160
Otherwise, Mr. Xu wouldn't have

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.120
picked you.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.600
I'll go.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.120
He can fish his fish.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.000
I'll wait in the car.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:22.680
He can stay his place.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.480
I won't go.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.240
Why are you acting crazy?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.100
It's not like you never
kept him company before.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.480
Did I ever get to choose?

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.080
Stop asking what you know.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.919
Enough. Save it.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.639
People come and go here.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.120
Do you know how many

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.480
wanted to take you away?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.799
Once they heard you did time,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.960
they all backed off.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.639
Have some self-awareness.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.000
Mr. Wu's gesture is rare.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.720
Cherish it.

Drink with me.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:16.759
Don't touch me.

Who are you?

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:29.240
Qu Meng, who is he?

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.360
Call security.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360
Go, upstairs.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.679
Move.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.879
Stop!

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.559
What are you doing?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.399
Don't run.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.000
Stop.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.400

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:58.960

- Don't run.
- What happened?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.039
Stop!

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:43.639
I asked around about you.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.500
Your name's Yang Wenyuan, right?

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.960
Why did you lie on the tracks?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.480
Sometimes,

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:00.720
I just want to feel death.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:05.240
I've been submitting to poetry journals.

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:14.799
This is yours.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.960
Thanks for that day.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.600
I'm returning it to you.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.720
You came just to return this?

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:30.320
I heard this golden ball
is exclusive to this place.

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:32.279
I did find you.

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.200
Wait here.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.679
You can get some sleep.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.840
I get off at 6:00 AM tomorrow.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080
I'll take you out then.

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:43.799
I... I'm writing something.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.080
I want to borrow your name

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.799
as the main character.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.240
What kind of writing?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.519
A novel.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.639
An essay.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.360
Maybe a poem.

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:56.840
Can I know you better?

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:06.440
Idiot.

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:15.279
People are divided into ranks.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.240
We're not from the same world.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.200
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:25.720
Don't come to places like this again.

00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:27.679
In my writing,

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:29.559
we can be from the same world.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.240
In your writing,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.360
what kind of person am I?

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.759
Someone who loves freedom.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.799
Wait.

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.519
Hurry up.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.279
Sorry.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:12.039
Let's go.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.399
Don't look around. Move.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:15.720
Don't come back.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.879
(His name is Yang Wenyuan.)

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.519
(A local newspaper reporter,)

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:28.720
(but he wants to be a poet.)

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.690
(I heard he lay on the tracks yesterday)

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.679
(to feel near death.)

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.120
(There really are idiots like this.)

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.159
How did he find this place?

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.639
Why bring him upstairs?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.120
Did he see the girls?

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:59.320
I know how to handle
the club's business.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.600
Qu Meng.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.399
Think carefully

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:09.279
about what Mr. Wang said.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.799
Do you think we and Mr. Wang

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:16.720
are from the same world?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.759
Why wouldn't we be?

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.690
Don't they eat, drink, use the toilet,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.639
sleep and breathe?

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:30.759
It's different.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.360
Mr. Jin.

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:44.559
Open a bottle

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:45.720
of Remy Martin.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.360
Once Remy is opened,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.600
good things will follow.

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:49.840
Naturally.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.100

Is Mr. Wang's fishing trip settled?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.720
That girl Qu Meng

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:52.680
is difficult.

00:17:53.319 --> 00:17:54.160
She's too stubborn.

00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:57.400
You can't force her.

00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:58.759
You have to be gentle.

00:17:58.839 --> 00:18:00.079
Got it.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.920
Mr. Wu.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.440
I just mentioned Qu Meng, and you...

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.799
Why do you sound jealous?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.480
Who's jealous?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.920
You're jealous.

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:21.119
The whole room smells of your jealousy.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.720
Don't be jealous.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.990
I'm going on a business trip
in a couple of days.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:31.400
I'm helping Xu sign a contract.

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:34.319
A big contract.

00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:37.000
Talk to Mr. Xu.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.920
Don't keep running around.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.799
Isn't it fine to stay at the restaurant?

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.839
They pay me a salary,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.599
so I have to work myself to death.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.759
As the old saying goes,

00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:51.039
if you're paid, you handle the trouble.

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:55.440
Now, everyone is doing real business.

00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:01.160
We can't afford to fall behind.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.759
Any news this month?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.559
No.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.680
Maybe when I go
on a business trip to Hong Kong, China,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.279
you can come with me and check.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.000
See if it's your problem

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
or mine.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.640
Have you lost your mind?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.440
What?

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.000
It's definitely your problem.

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:34.240
You can't say it like that.

00:19:59.759 --> 00:20:00.880
You're just too thin.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.960
Look at how thin you are.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:05.799
Without some flesh,
the outfit won't fit.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.640
Eat more.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.000
I've gained some weight recently.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:10.799
Mr. Liu.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:11.960
Hurry.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:13.839
Let's go.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.039
Looking for Qu Meng?

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.400
What are you holding?

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:33.359
I came to return clothes.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.759
You came all the way here

00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:35.880
just to return clothes?

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:41.880
Let me check.

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:49.319
I promised her to write a poem for her.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.920
I want her to see it.

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:54.079
You already set up a meeting.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.759
Scholar, you call this a poem?

00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:58.079
Qu Meng really has sharp eyes for men.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.920
I knew you'd be meddling secretly.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.160
She told me to wait for you here.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.920
It's too shaky.

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:10.960
Help me a bit.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.759
Help me.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.640
Ms. He.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.640
Let me hold. I can't walk steadily.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.960
Why are you so shy?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.480
Never had a girl hold you?

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:35.200
Distinguished guests.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.599
Good evening, everyone.

00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:40.480
Welcome to the International Club.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.799
- Good.
- Good.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.720
First,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.160
let me share some good news.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.480
Our club

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.559
was rated last year

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:54.240
as Binchuan City's top dining place.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.759
This is thanks to your support.

00:21:56.759 --> 00:21:58.020
She told you not to overthink it.

00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.799
That ball is just for show.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.200
Like those flashy people

00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:05.559
who all wear suits.

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:07.720
They're not as comfy
as tanks and shorts.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.240
It's just about style.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.880
I saw everything.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.359
This ball

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:25.559
is for the lucky draw.

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:27.559
Yes.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.759
A lucky draw.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.210
We're drawing today too.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.880
We've specially prepared
a lucky draw for you.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.599
We'll have the results soon.
Try your luck.

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:39.960
There are three prize tiers.

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:40.720
Take this.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.720
Want a drink? I'll get you one.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.930
Give me a second.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.400
1,000 yuan in cash.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.319
With the Fu character, second prize.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.799
A gold bracelet.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.440
Here comes the exciting part.

00:22:58.599 --> 00:22:59.640
With the Ya character,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.319
first prize, a Rolex gold watch.

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:05.079
A gold Rolex.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.519
Today, we've also prepared
a special prize.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.880
The special prize is

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.240
to sing a duet with our club's
Golden Ball Angel,

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:31.599
Qu Meng.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.599
So who drew the Golden Ball?

00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:36.079
Where's the Golden Ball?

00:23:36.839 --> 00:23:38.240
Where's the Golden Ball?

00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:40.839
Where's the Golden Ball?

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:41.839
Here it is!

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640
Hurry up. Stand up.

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:48.319
Let's congratulate him.

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:50.119
Congratulations.

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:52.480
Good. How lucky.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.480
Move. Don't just stand there.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.960
Go on. Get on it.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.519
Get on it. Go.

00:23:58.519 --> 00:23:59.880
Hurry. Go on.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.319
Qu Meng's waiting there. Go.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.080
Congratulations.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.039
Don't be shy, young man.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.559
- Go on.
- Get up there.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.599
- Get up there.
- Get up there.

00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:10.839

- Sing one.
- Sing one.

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:36.400
- Good.
- Good.

Hello.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.160
Singing lady.

00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:53.880
Hello.

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:58.240
When the neon river flood the banks,

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.279
your laughter

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.599
is the sail that won't sink.

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:07.000
When distant starlight cuts the clouds,

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:09.440
your singing

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:11.640
is an untamed flame.

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:14.279
Don't be afraid.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.880
The nightingale also waited in thorns,

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.400
just to sing defiant notes.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.680
Don't be afraid.

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:27.559
Seeds break through ruins to rise,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.400
only to pierce the pain and take root.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.079
Every grain of dust will awaken.

00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:39.640
Every soul is surging.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.000
Light will cross a thousand years.

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:46.559
Flowers will eventually
bloom before our eyes.

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:49.519
Between light and flowers,

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.680
I saw your tears.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.480
They shimmer

00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:58.759
and shatter into stars in neon.

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:00.920
Hello.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.519
Miss.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.279
Hello.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.160
- Good.
- Good.

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:26.480
- Good.
- Good.

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:37.920
Talk.

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:40.200
What was tonight about?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.400
Reciting poems too. It's quite novel.

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:46.079
Mr. Xu, this is on me.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:47.960
I didn't think it through.

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:50.200
This isn't the time to blame.

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.440
We're family. Fix this first.

00:27:54.079 --> 00:27:54.920
It's no big deal.

00:27:55.319 --> 00:27:57.559
He probably didn't get the trick.

00:27:58.039 --> 00:28:00.519
He saw the raffle earlier.

00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:01.920
He's just curious.

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:03.319
It's fine now.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.359
People like him has no backing.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.400
Give him cash and send him off.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.799
You think money is easy to make?

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.319
He caused trouble without spending.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.359
We earned this on knife edges.

00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:13.480
You just give it away?

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:16.960
Mr. Xu.

00:28:24.039 --> 00:28:24.559
Here.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.759
Apologize to Mr. Xu.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.920
I caused this.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.079
I'll handle it.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.680
Where is he?

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:37.319
He was sent away.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.359
He's gone?

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:41.440
No one saw him leave.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.599
Yang Wen... Yang Wenyuan.

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:33.839
Qu Meng wears this too.

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:36.079
Do you all do this?

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:38.759
Does she do this too?

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.359
Get lost.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.000
You were forced, right?

00:29:43.319 --> 00:29:44.440
Go.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.920
It's too late.

00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:28.599
(People are divided into ranks.)

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.500
(We're not from the same world.)

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.390
(Don't ask what you shouldn't.)

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.799
(Don't come)

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.150
(to places like this again.)

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.240
Yang Wenyuan!

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:46.240
(Binchuan Police Shunyang Road Station)
Stop. What are you doing?

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.559
I came looking for you,

00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:51.799
just wanting to see
what the club is all about.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.279
Now there's no need.

00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:57.480
It won't work.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.000
The police have checked many times,

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.880
but no one dares tell the truth.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.599
Don't get yourself involved.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.000
Stop it. Go back with me.

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:10.240
What are you doing?

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.720
Not coming back?

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:27.559
Are you leaving or not?

00:31:27.839 --> 00:31:28.359
Sir.

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:30.319
Is there a problem?

00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:41.559
What are you doing? Look at yourself.

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:43.039
Stop it, you...

00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:46.160
You even made the police come out.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.839
Sir.

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:49.839
How about you talk inside?

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:57.599
We're fine.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:58.920
Sorry.

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:02.720
Alright, that's enough.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.480
Give me a hug.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.680
They've fallen in love.

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:41.359
Let's go.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.880
We searched everywhere.

00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:54.519
This guy didn't hide anything.

00:33:17.119 --> 00:33:18.119
Are you doing it too?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.279
Get up.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.680
Get up!

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.200
Okay.

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:47.039
I provoked you first.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.400
Consider it my compensation.

00:33:53.359 --> 00:33:54.240
Qu Meng, don't do this.

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:55.759
I said, don't do this.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.720
Don't do this.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.119
You think I'm dirty?

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.559
Yang Wenyuan,
you have no right to think we're dirty.

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:24.480
Do you know what it's like

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.800
to have no money to feed yourself?

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.519
I was the third girl in my family.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.599
In ninth grade, my mom left.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.199
My stepfather sold my eldest sister.

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:39.280
One day, my second sister

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.719
suddenly went with him
to the city to buy medicine

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.199
and never returned.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.960
I escaped alone

00:34:55.519 --> 00:34:56.559
and came to Binchuan.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.360
At first, I worked in a small restaurant

00:35:00.719 --> 00:35:01.559
as a waitress.

00:35:02.719 --> 00:35:03.679
One day,

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.800
a group of men
suddenly started groping me.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.590
I refused to comply.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.280
They took advantage of my drunkenness,

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.480
locked me in a private room,
and raped me.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.159
I made a scene,

00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:16.559
so they falsely accused me of stealing.

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:18.719
Eventually, they threw me in jail.

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:21.000
Well?

00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:23.880
Not what you imagined, right?

00:35:28.639 --> 00:35:31.199
You think I was born wanting that job?

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.679
Am I born that lowly?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.880
Yes, we were young and naive,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.119
being led in like headless flies.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.960
We thought we found a shortcut
and thought we could still get out.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:44.510
But once you're on the thief's ship,

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:46.719
there's no getting off.

00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:50.039
I can help you.

00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:50.960
How?

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.190
I'll take you away from here.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.840
I work in the club.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.079
Who would let me go?

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:11.119
Since you're already involved,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.280
we can only use their methods.

00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:18.159
Leave Binchuan.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.159
The club,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.639
what we are, and what we do

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:24.400
doesn't matter.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.320
Our roots were ground away long ago.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.920
We're asleep for too long.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.800
We can't wake up.

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:32.079
A poor poet like you

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:33.880
shouldn't imagine using us

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:35.559
to satisfy your idealism.

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:37.880
All your self-indulgent words

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.480
only cause trouble for others.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.639
They're useless.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.119
I'd say stop dreaming here.

00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:44.760
Take the money,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.119
write your lousy poems,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.150
and don't come back for me.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.480
It won't end well.

00:37:05.719 --> 00:37:06.440
Go back.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.039
I said,

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.880
go back.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.719
Get lost!

00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:29.199
Just discipling him.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.920
Watch your limits.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.320
In other people's eyes,

00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:00.199
I'm just a convict for life.

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:02.280
My life is a dump.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.519
You're a great poet.

00:38:03.519 --> 00:38:04.780
I'm not worth you picking trash.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:05.679
Do you understand?

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.920
When I got out,

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.079
Ms. Hong brought me to the club.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.320
(Binchuan Correctional Institution)
But it wasn't at all what I imagined.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.480
You think I didn't resist?

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.039
You think I wanted to live like this?

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.519
In your eyes, I saw

00:38:34.519 --> 00:38:36.000
my former self.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.079
Dreams in my heart.

00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:40.480
Light in my eyes.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.519
Why hasn't the driver returned yet?

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:18.639
Meng.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:20.719
You seem worried.

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:24.800
If you're unhappy at the club,

00:39:25.559 --> 00:39:27.880
tell me anytime. I'll get you a new job.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.880
Do you know
why I like listening to you sing?

00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:36.679
When you sing "Sweet as Honey", it's...

00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:44.000
♪Sweet as honey. Your smile is sweet♪

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.199
I always feel my vocal technique
and breath control are lacking.

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:51.360
Touch it. My breath...

00:39:52.119 --> 00:39:52.679
Feel it.

00:39:53.079 --> 00:39:58.320
♪Sweet as honey. Your smile is sweet♪

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.000
Meng, do you think

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.760
this breath is...

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:05.960
What's going on?

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.679
Go, hurry.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.800
(Dance Hall)
Let's check it out.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.880
What's happening?

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.180
What's going on? What's the situation?

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:13.880
Exactly.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.780
(Awake)

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.260
(Awake)

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.079
Awake!

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.119
Get up!

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.519
Hello, singing lady.

00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:05.800
When the neon river flood the banks,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360
your laughter

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.039
is the sail that won't sink.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.440
When distant starlight cuts the clouds,

00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:16.320
your singing

00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:18.360
is an untamed flame.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.199
Don't be afraid.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.920
The nightingale also waited in thorns,

00:41:25.039 --> 00:41:27.480
just to sing defiant notes.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.000
Don't be afraid.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.000
Seeds break through ruins to rise,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.440
only to pierce the pain and take root.
