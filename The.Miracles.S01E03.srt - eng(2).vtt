Every yak in Xizang has a name.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.780
Can you believe it?

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:56.460
Loudima.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:57.060
Donggeimai.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.939
Dunzhu Zhuoma.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.979
No, no, no. I'm not talking about them.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.219
But this little one.

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:02.820
I need to put an ear tag

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:03.539
on its ear.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.579
We've been in a standoff

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:05.579
for five minutes and thirteen seconds.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.379
The last time I

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:07.659
looked at a cow this intently

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:08.579
was this one.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.579
And this one.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:11.019
And... wait, wrong.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.939
This is the one.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:14.900
Daddy, Daddy, I miss you!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.980
Niu Niu and Niu Niu.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.500
have been a constant in my life.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.579
What does this weird uncle want?

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:21.420
Little Niu Niu.

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.859
I'm going to give you an ear tag.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:23.659
It won't hurt at all.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:25.099
I don't believe you.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:26.579
Don't come any closer!

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.579
Be good, be good, be good.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.260
Don't come over.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.659
If you come any closer, I'll...

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:31.620
Alright, come on.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900
I... I... I'll fight him!

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.900
Why did I come here?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.579
Leaving my job

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.900
and Shenzhen, where I lived for over a decade,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.219
to come to Xizang, over three thousand kilometers away,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.939
to wrestle with a yak?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.019
My name is Zhang Zhaoyuan, from Shenzhen.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.780
I came to Xizang to promote yak insurance.

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:51.260
Zhaoyuan.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.780
The company wants to strengthen

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.620
its insurance operations in Xizang,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.859
Qinghai, and other regions.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.379
To promote the national agricultural support policies,

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.980
we need to send our best people

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:59.500
to insure the yaks.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.260
The work will be very challenging.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.140
Are you willing to go?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.980
Sending you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.579
is because we believe you have the ability

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.500
to fight the tough battles

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.420
and create miracles.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.340
Hello.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:25.979
This is

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:26.379
Brother Zhang.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.580
This... this is our savior.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.939
The big boss from the Shenzhen headquarters.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.780
Hello, boss.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.539
I'm not some big boss.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.219
We're all just working folks.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:36.860
Hello.

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.259
My name is Zhang Zhaoyuan.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.699
From now on, we're colleagues.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.819
What should I call you?

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.340
Brother Zhang.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.340
You can just call me Hazha.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.620
I'm really just here to support.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.020
I'll be counting on you from now on.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.419
Of course, of course.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.219
Brother Zhang.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.539
It was too late yesterday,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.139
we didn't have time to chat properly.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:55.340
You know, we've

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.419
been working for a few months now.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.699
To be honest,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.219
it's been full of difficulties.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:00.580
I feel like my job

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.219
is about to be lost.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.099
You know,

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.259
if I really had to leave Xizang,

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.699
I'd actually be a bit reluctant.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.460
What specific difficulties are there?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.139
Tell me.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.939
Well, Brother,

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.939
let me report to you first.

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:11.180
It's like this.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.979
Look,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.819
our equipment

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:14.939
has been ready for a while.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.699
See, it can display

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.020
the yak count, location,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.620
and vital signs.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:21.699
It can show everything.

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.020
It's just that the locals

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.500
still can't quite accept it.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.180
We've done

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.139
several rounds of work.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:27.699
The results still aren't good.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:28.419
Right.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.300
But that's not specific enough.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.539
For example, last month,

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.379
Wangmu's yak

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.259
got eaten by a snow leopard.

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.259
I thought to myself,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.139
"Even a blind sparrow won't starve."

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.379
Isn't this a great opportunity

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.020
to promote yak insurance?

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.099
So the two of us went.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.020
Guess what Wangmu said?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.020
"If it's eaten, then it's eaten.

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:45.860
This way the snow leopard won't starve."

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.580
I was completely stunned at the time.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.419
This herder

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.939
felt it was just fate.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.219
But the yak can't

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.500
just be eaten by a snow leopard, right?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.939
That's exactly what I'm saying.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.539
I understand the basic situation.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.819
But it's okay.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.020
The more difficult it is,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.419
the more challenging it is.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.340
Let me introduce myself.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.939
I'm from the Shenzhen headquarters.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.979
A six-time consecutive Quarterly Star.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.099
No matter how tough the project,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.979
I can handle it.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.139
One month's time.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.860
Within the jurisdiction,

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:16.980
one hundred thousand yaks

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.660
must all be insured.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.180
Take it easy, take it easy.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.779
Go away. Don't be impatient.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.540
They are family.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.540
They've lived here for decades.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.860
You city folk,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.980
why are you disturbing them?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.060
What is he saying?

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:30.300
Why is he chasing us out?

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.180
He's not chasing us out.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.939
He's not chasing us.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.139
We are here to

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.939
protect your money.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.220
Just with a piece of paper?

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.980
Can you make his dog stop barking?

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:40.779
What is he saying?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.139
Is he cursing my dog?

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.540
Your dog keeps barking.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:46.740
It's giving me a headache.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.779
Stop barking!

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:48.259
Don't you shout!

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.139
You need to be

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:49.699
more polite to our client.

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.459
He just can't understand

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:52.899
what this thing is.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.339
The state is spending so much money for you.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.899
You'll have security afterwards.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.860
If it's lost or dies,

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:58.980
you'll get compensation.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.899
What a great thing!

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.100
We're not lying to you.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.540
Brother Zhang is a good man!

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.180
You... you just don't get it, do you?

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.420
Are you speaking Chinese to me?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.860
Brother Zhang.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.939
Here, have a sip.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.860
No need, I'm long over the altitude sickness.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:14.819
Which family are we visiting today?

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:17.339
We're going to Grandma Zhuoma's house today.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.379
Let me tell you,

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:19.699
she has a lot of yaks.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:20.620
That's good.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.019
It's just that she's a bit stubborn.

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:23.459
What's there to fear about stubbornness?

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:24.779
Our policies are so good.

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:26.019
How could we not promote them successfully?

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.060
Let's go back to the beginning.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.060
Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang!

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.019
Quick, quick, quick! Got it!

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.899
Brother Zhang, come quick! Brother Zhang!

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.459
Quick, grab it!

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:38.939
Brother Zhang, come quick! Brother Zhang!

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.420
Quick, quick! Don't move, don't move!

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.459
Grandma Zhuoma!

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:48.100
No, no, no, don't!

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.819
You agreed to put on the ear tag!

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:50.660
You said it was okay!

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.420
Who told you to poke a hole in its ear?

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:56.740
Grandma Zhuoma

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:57.899
This ear tag is meant to go on the ear.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:59.259
It can't go anywhere else.

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:00.100
You have to understand.

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:01.459
Then don't put it on.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:02.620
No.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:04.699
Look at all these yaks behind you.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.139
They all have it.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.459
See, they're happily grazing, full of life.

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:10.139
So much energy.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.300
They can handle it.

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:12.660
It can't.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:13.339
It's still young.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.220
It's afraid of pain.

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.699
It just called for me to save it.

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:18.420
Called for you to save it.

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:19.100
Yes.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.540
No, Grandma, about this...

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.779
Look, we get our ears pierced too.

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.139
It doesn't hurt. Just a quick pinch.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.019
It's over in a tiny moment.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.019
I'm afraid of pain.

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:30.540
I don't get my ears pierced.

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:31.339
I don't wear earrings either.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.259
I won't allow it.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.779
Won't allow it.

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:35.339
Alright then.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.259
Brother Zhang.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.339
So here's the thing.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.019
Just now, this little yak...

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.699
It cried for help.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:42.860
Grandma heard it.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.100
So she came over to save it.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.660
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:46.660
It called out twice.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:47.699
She could hear it from that far?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.899
And she could understand what it said?

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:50.779
It's like this for us.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.939
People...

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:53.100
and cattle...

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:54.540
or other animals...

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.339
There's this kind of...

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.980
It's just a sudden... connection.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:59.019
I get it.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.939
Telepathy, right?

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:01.939
Yes, telepathy.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:04.699
Bro.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.139
How about this?

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:09.420
Let's just skip this little yak.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:10.100
How can we do that?

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:11.100
We can't make exceptions.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:14.500
What's this yak's name?

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:16.740
What's it called?

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:18.180
Niu Niu.

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:18.620
Niu Niu.

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:21.379
It's Niu Niu.

00:07:21.579 --> 00:07:21.980
I...

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.139
I asked for its name.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:24.939
I know it's a yak.

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:25.939
Its name is Niu Niu.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.019
It's just called Niu Niu.

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:29.699
Yes, Niu Niu.

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:31.180
You name your yaks...

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.180
so casually?

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:33.620
No, not casually.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:37.300
Its name in Xizang language...

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.300
is Yak.

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.579
Translated into Chinese...

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:41.899
it's Niu Niu.

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:42.819
Niu Niu.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:43.819
Niu Niu, right?

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.180
Yes.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.980
Grandma Zhuoma.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.139
Its name is Niu Niu.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.540
Grandma Zhuoma.

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:52.540
Its name is Niu Niu.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.660
What a coincidence!

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:56.779
My daughter's nickname is Niu Niu too.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.740
See, how amazing is that?

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.019
So when I see it...

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.899
it's like seeing my own daughter.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:03.860
Think about it.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.339
If I were putting this ear tag on my daughter...

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.540
how could I use force?

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.860
In a moment, I'll just...

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.139
gently...

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:11.740
press it like this.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.060
It won't hurt at all.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.259
No pain.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.860
Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang!

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.180
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.420
No.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.379
What on earth did you translate to her?

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:21.860
I just translated exactly what you said.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.899
What? What did you say?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.819
This Grandma Zhuoma...

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:24.860
has quite the temper.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.300
What exactly did you tell her?

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:28.420
Did you tell her before...

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.740
that buying yak insurance...

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:31.100
protects the herders' interests?

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:32.860
Brother Zhang, I really did say it.

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:35.059
And I said everything I was supposed to.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.500
We have to keep saying it, over and over.

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:37.740
We're in insurance.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.059
There's no secret trick, right?

00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:40.299
It's just about repeatedly...

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.179
putting our message out there.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.059
Doing promotion is like ironing clothes.

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:44.820
You push your idea out...

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:45.820
and then smooth it back in.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:47.740
That's how you leave your mark.

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:48.659
Yes, bro.

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.059
But we don't iron clothes.

00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:52.419
It's an analogy.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.500
You understand analogies, right?

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.740
When we first got here...

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.019
how little yak insurance had we sold?

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:57.139
And how many head do we have now?

00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:58.740
That's your ironed clothes.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.259
Right.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.299
That makes sense.

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:01.820
We've made progress.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.580
Brother Zhang, you're amazing.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.100
I give you a thumbs up.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.460
Quarterly Star.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.580
Quarterly Star.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.139
Six times.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.419
Brother Zhang, Brother Zhang.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.580
Are you okay?

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:15.700
I'm fine.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.700
There's dung.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.539
These darn yaks

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:28.659
Why do they poop so much?

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:30.139
And every pile is so huge.

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:31.139
What's wrong with big?

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:32.460
You just don't understand.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.659
Yak dung is incredibly useful.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.740
It can fuel fires, boil milk tea.

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:38.940
Build houses, raise courtyard walls.

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:40.299
Be carved into decorations.

00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:41.500
Even the meals

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.139
we Tibetans eat at home

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.860
are cooked with yak dung.

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:46.500
It tastes wonderful.

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:50.100
Bro, what's wrong?

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:50.580
Hazha!

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.259
You're like a blacksmith burning his own butt.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.019
You can't read the room.

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:54.860
Is this the right time

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.220
to talk about food with Brother Zhang?

00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:57.980
And is it right for you to mention butts?

00:09:58.059 --> 00:09:59.500
That's still better than talking about food!

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.899
Brother Zhang just ate that stuff...

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.539
Ugh!

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:03.379
Are you two doing this on purpose?

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.340
Will you ever stop?

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:06.740
Bro, it wasn't on purpose.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.779
Bro.

00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:15.419
I'm not lying to you.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.460
Once yak dung is dried,

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.659
it has no smell at all.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.500
Brother Zhang.

00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:28.139
If one day

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:29.860
you can accept yak dung,

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:31.779
it will prove

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.139
you truly understand us.

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:52.860
Old Mou just called to ask

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.620
when the two of us are going back.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.500
This rain won't stop

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.340
for a while.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.779
We'll stay here tonight.

00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:01.899
Sleep here?

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:02.580
Yeah.

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:03.740
Isn't this nice?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.500
We have everything we need.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.580
Wait, wait.

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:13.019
Wipe your hands.

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:15.740
It's fine.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:16.899
Alright, alright.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.340
Have some tea to warm up.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.820
Then come quickly and tell me,

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:26.299
is this yak Dongrulai

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:27.019
or Kabu?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.139
They all look the same.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.419
This one...

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:31.620
This yak

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.860
is not Dongrulai.

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:34.019
This is

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.059
Daren's Nuo'er.

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:38.340
It means "treasure."

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:39.700
So this is Nuo'er.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.019
Yes, little treasure.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.139
Then look at this one.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.860
This is Dongrulai, right?

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:44.940
Nope.

00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:46.740
This is also Daren's.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:47.620
It's called Gang.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.860
It means "above" or "on top."

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.580
As far as I can see,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.659
they all look pretty similar.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:58.179
What are you laughing at?

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:00.899
Hearing you say that

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:02.259
suddenly made me think.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.340
You can't tell these yaks apart,

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.700
just like us locals

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.220
can't understand that

00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:11.340
policy of yours.

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:13.620
Every single word in it,

00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:14.139
separately,

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:15.179
we recognize.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.500
But when you put those words together,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.740
we don't understand.

00:12:21.259 --> 00:12:22.059
It's leaking over there.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.100
Is that okay?

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.700
Let it leak.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.779
It's fine, you're not sleeping there.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:29.139
We're sleeping here, what's there to fear?

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.019
No,

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:31.500
your

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.580
dung is getting soaked.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:33.659
This, this...

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:35.460
The dung?

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.460
So it gets wet, there's plenty here.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.259
There's lots of dry dung.

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:40.940
You know what?

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:43.259
When this dung is dried and burned,

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:43.899
it's not smelly at all.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:44.740
Right.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.379
It even has a bit of a fragrance.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.740
Let me tell you,

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:50.500
the yaks here

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.740
all grow up eating green grass.

00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:55.100
Completely natural and healthy.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.620
Let me tell you another secret.

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:01.500
Some yaks have great taste.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.580
They eat cordyceps.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.379
You know cordyceps, right?

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.379
Stop bragging.

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:08.539
Eating cordyceps?

00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:10.500
I'm really not bragging.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:12.460
This...

00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:14.019
This here...

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.340
Isn't this it? Here.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.340
Bro.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.659
Co... cordyceps?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.299
This is... this is dry grass.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:20.899
This is dry grass.

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:21.820
Cordyceps, my foot.

00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:24.820
I've always been curious,

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:26.259
what kind of place

00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:27.139
Shenzhen really is.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.100
And also,

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:29.740
you must be

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.220
a really

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.700
important big shot in Shenzhen.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.139
What big shot am I?

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.860
Let me tell you

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.860
what kind of place Shenzhen is.

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:38.139
Shenzhen is a place

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:40.139
where even the air is running.

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:41.899
Even the air is running?

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:44.220
What if you don't run?

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:45.659
Then you fall behind.

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:46.940
Fall behind...

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:50.860
Life here is

00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:52.059
quite different.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.340
Take us, for example.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.220
Every day,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.460
we ride horses, herd yaks,

00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:01.179
bask in the sun, drink some butter tea.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.980
When the sun sets,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.100
we return to the yurt.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.580
Sing and dance.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.059
Life is a bit slower,

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:09.539
but our hearts are never anxious.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:12.019
We're not afraid of falling behind at all.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.379
Brother

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:26.019
We've only tagged two thousand.

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:28.460
We're way off target.

00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:30.620
I'm the Quarterly Star.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.779
We have to believe in miracles.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.700
Believe in miracles.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.860
Believe in miracles.

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:38.740
Hurry up and fly it! I'll chase you!

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.340
Now we'll put this photo

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.620
in this slot.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:43.179
Okay.

00:14:57.259 --> 00:14:59.019
It's flying! So cool!

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.100
Every time I see it take off,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.220
my heart swells with excitement.

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:02.980
Look!

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:03.899
You try.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.740
Me? No, no, no.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.019
Believe in yourself. You can do it.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:07.419
Here.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.139
This one on the left

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:10.779
controls ascent and descent.

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:13.860
The right one controls direction.

00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:15.500
Watching you fly every day,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.860
I've picked up a little.

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:18.220
Not bad, you.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.500
It's flying away! It's gone!

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.419
Alright, alright.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:21.899
Fly, fly, fly!

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.460
Little Niu Niu.

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:35.500
We meet again.

00:15:36.659 --> 00:15:37.539
This strange uncle

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:38.659
is trying to trick me again.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.019
I'm a good person.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.379
Listen to me.

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:46.259
If we tag your ear,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.259
if we tag your ear,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.740
and you get lost,

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:52.899
we can find you.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.620
If someday, by chance...

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.460
I mean, just *if*...

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.539
If you were to pass away,

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:00.620
how sad and heartbroken Grandma would be.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.500
Let's pick a day

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:06.620
to just give you a little tag.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:07.980
Zhang.

00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:10.139
Grandma.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.980
Yak is a good yak.

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:15.860
Has a hard life.

00:16:16.259 --> 00:16:18.019
Difficult birth. Its mother died.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.779
It has no mother to love it.

00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:21.299
I love it.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.700
Grandma.

00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:27.460
Let me show you.

00:16:28.539 --> 00:16:28.940
Her.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.259
My daughter.

00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:33.340
My daughter's name is Niu Niu.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.019
It.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.740
Is called Niu Niu.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.539
The names are the same.

00:16:39.539 --> 00:16:41.139
I love her.

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:42.740
Protect her.

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:44.860
I also love it.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.100
Protect it.

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:47.899
Protect.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.139
Zhang.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:55.779
I understand.

00:16:56.419 --> 00:16:59.779
I will think carefully about this.
