WEBVTT

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.439
So beautiful.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.039
This one's pretty too.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.359
What are you doing here?

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.159
What?

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.600
You're not happy to see me?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.520
I invited Qixing.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.719
Today is my birthday.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.719
It's your birthday today?

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:05.799
Yeah.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.400
So...

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.280
Today, you two have a special privilege.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.719
You order the dishes.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:11.760
I'll cook them.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.000
How about that?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.680
You'll make anything we order?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.480
Of course.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.840
I'll learn as I go.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.239
Go on.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.359
What would you like to eat?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.959
Let me think...

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
Then I want...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.719
Clover sprouts.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:25.400
Stir-fried dried tofu.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.359
Let's have steamed perch.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.799
Porcini mushrooms.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.439
Okay.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:31.760
And one more.

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:34.879
That dish we used to love.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.439
Fragrant Crispy Delight.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.760
I'll have one.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.719
These dishes...

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.000
Should be enough for the three of us, right?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.040
It's your birthday, you're the boss.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.599
You just said you two...

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.719
What's that dish you loved called?

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.719
Fragrant Crispy Delight.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.359
The recipe for Fragrant Crispy Delight.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.599
You're looking up the recipe now?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.599
Yeah.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.159
Learn on the spot.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.680
Cook on the spot.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.919
Tastes good, right?

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.080
I'm an honest person.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.919
Today, in the name of my birthday,

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.319
I invited you two here

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.319
with the goal of getting you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520
to make up.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.680
Go back to how things were.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.639
Let me state first,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.639
He and I...

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680
We're a fake couple.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.400
Please don't mind that.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.360
What's wrong?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.080
What if he doesn't want to start over?

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.840
He's pretending.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.759
You have no idea.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.000
Yesterday on set,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.080
when he saw you were hurt,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.960
he was more nervous than anyone.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.120
Those eyes of his...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.400
Anyone with eyes could see it.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.199
Really.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.319
Xin Tong, you just don't understand the situation.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.319
I do understand.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.840
You just...

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.919
Listen to me.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:04.840
You two...

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.800
Right now, it's just that...

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.280
Neither of you is willing to take the first step.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.080
Listen to me.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.520
I really don't want to see two people

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.840
who truly love each other

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.039
miss each other like this.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.639
Sometimes, if you miss it,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.479
it's for a lifetime.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.520
Come on.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.680
Let's have a drink.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.000
Drink until we're drunk.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.800
We won't leave until we're drunk.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.960
The Fragrant Crispy Delight

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.919
you love.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.000
Eat more.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.840
Cheers.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.719
I've had too much to drink.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.919
As for your business,

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.719
you two sort it out yourselves.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.319
I won't meddle anymore.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.560
I'll first...

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.560
go to sleep.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240
It's getting late anyway.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.159
Let's call it a night.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.960
No.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280
You have to keep going.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.160
You have to keep talking.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.519
You'd better come to some conclusion.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.199
Xin Tong.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.399
Don't be willful.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.279
I can see it.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.800
You two probably haven't drunk enough yet.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.800
Since you're like this,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.079
it feels like I'm the one

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:30.160
breaking up the party.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.079
Come on, come on.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.959
Then I'll have a little more with you two.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.560
Let's see what kind of result

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.240
you two can talk out.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.879
Here.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.639
Don't let all this good food go to waste.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:02.240
Who would have thought

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.839
You're quite patient with her

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.160
It seems my guess was right

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.199
Brother

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.800
You're in pretty deep, aren't you?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.600
We just have a cooperative relationship

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.680
Still talking tough

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.360
Don't you want to know

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.040
whether Xin Tong actually likes you?

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.920
What reason would she have not to like me?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.199
Being full of hot air, aside from the smell

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.839
is completely useless

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.240
Alright

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.079
Then tell me

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.519
what is your insight

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.199
I think...

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.079
I think...

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:42.680
Today

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.279
on this

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.800
incredibly important day

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.439
I want to join you two

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.240
to form a three-person team

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.360
to discuss together

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.319
the grand plan for Four Seas

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.199
to discuss

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.360
how to help Qixing

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.639
win back

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.399
the top management rights of Four Seas

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.639
Question

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.199
Go ahead

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.160
Is your boss really that bad?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.759
Good question

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:17.600
This boss of mine...

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.560
has three major crimes

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.439
Number three

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.439
The proposal I slaved over all night

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:29.199
he told me it lacked data support

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.160
Is data that important?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.040
Number two

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.480
People like us

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.519
who have struggled for a living since childhood

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.079
and gave up our studies

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.759
are we really that bad?

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:40.040
Are we really inferior to

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.720
those graduates from prestigious schools?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.600
Can he truly see our abilities?

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.920
And the most important point

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.319
is that he

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.399
is petty

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.720
Qixing is clearly very capable

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.360
He's afraid Qixing's ability will overshadow his own

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.680
so he won't sign his own sister

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:59.959
His heart is really just

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.439
this

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:03.079
big

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.160
and no more

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:07.600
So

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
is this fair?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.240
You think it's unfair too, right?

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:14.319
Exactly

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.839
In this world

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.759
where is there so much fairness?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.759
Qixing

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.120
she is clearly already excellent

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720
but just because

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.240
she is a girl

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.279
she is

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.480
marginalized by the family

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.839
and they euphemistically claim

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.240
it's out of

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.480
protection for a girl

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.439
Do you know how hard girls these days

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.199
have to work to get

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.399
what boys get

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.759
from the moment they are born?

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:51.720
Qixing

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:55.879
I know

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.519
you must be very defiant

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.079
The reason you changed your name

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.319
is because you want

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.680
to hold your destiny

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.000
firmly in your own hands

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.399
You are amazing

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:16.199
Is it that

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.879
just because

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.680
I am a girl

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.560
that I

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.160
should be abandoned

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:24.319
by my parents?

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.600
Let me tell you two

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.480
a little secret

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.200
Actually, today isn't my birthday

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:39.200
Today is

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.440
the day I was adopted by the welfare institute

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.320
I simply don't know

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.360
when my birthday actually is

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:55.480
So

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360
I tell myself

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.200
I must work hard

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.559
I must work doubly hard

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.360
I must work hard to make money

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.080
I must work hard to prove myself

00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:07.240
Prove that I

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.799
that I am not that bad at all

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.759
I want to prove it to everyone

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.759
But I realized

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:16.879
it seems no one really cares about me

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.320
I don't know

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.879
who I should prove myself to

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.159
I care

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:27.919
You are excellent

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.639
I'll help you take down that bastard right now

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.159
Okay?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600
Down with that bastard

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.360
Down with him

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.080
Let's go now

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.120
Qixing

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.600
What Xin Tong just said

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.240
is that what you think too?

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.919
What I think

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:01.639
never seems to matter, does it?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.320
I just wanted to protect you

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:08.519
I've grown up, Brother

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:13.039
I can protect you too

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.039
Take good care of her

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.039
I'm going to sleep

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.879
It's so beautiful

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.240
You prepared all this?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.360
You prepared this for Qixing?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.960
Prepared for you

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:01.320
Xin Tong

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.840
I don't care what you encountered

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.879
before you met me

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:07.519
but I hope

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:09.000
every day from now on

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.279
will be full of color

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:11.919
just like these flowers

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.519
I will always be with you

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.080
Happy Birthday

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.480
Is there a secret agent here?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.960
No

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.080
No way

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.320
I must not be sober yet

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:48.519
My head really hurts

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:50.320
I'm going back to sleep

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:51.279
Goodnight

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.720
Then rest well

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:55.759
Are you okay?

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:57.120
I'm fine

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:03.480
Your room

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:05.799
is over there.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.120
I don't like it.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.840
What do you mean by saying that today?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.080
Don't tell me...

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.799
you actually like me?

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.039
Impossible.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.120
Absolutely impossible.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.039
Calm down.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.960
The two of you

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.399
are currently just in a

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.960
cooperative couple relationship.

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:51.919
Besides,

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.559
that guy is a total playboy.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.080
What's there to like?

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.080
Being with you

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.960
is just him playing a part.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.159
Don't you believe it.

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:07.879
But he...

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.200
isn't that much of a playboy, right?

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:55.519
Careful.

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:15.960
That bastard is personally picking up Qixing.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.000
The relationship between this brother and sister

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.639
looks pretty good, huh?

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:27.399
It's a bit too good, isn't it?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.600
This...
