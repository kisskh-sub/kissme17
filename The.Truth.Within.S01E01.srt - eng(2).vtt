00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.720
Just a heads-up.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.990
You and the new guy

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.520
have gotten close recently?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.310
What's wrong?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.670
Stay away from him. I hate him.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.350
He's a total loose cannon

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.110
and a loner.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.960
If he's such a free spirit,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.840
why didn't he stay

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.400
in Narcotics?

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.750
What's he doing on our squad?

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.430
Wan,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.430
Mr. Han just transferred from Narcotics.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.200
And he was undercover.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.790
He doesn't work the way

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.670
we do.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.520
Understandable.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.840
Understandable my ass!

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.160
I've been

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.480
on this squad for years.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.720
When Zhu joined

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.280
the squad,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.080
she was just a kid.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.200
How did he

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.350
parachute in as captain?

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.110
In skill, seniority, or brains,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.110
he's no match for Zhu,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.750
right?

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.670
Come on, Wan.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.990
Leave me out of it.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.400
Attention!

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.200
Homicide reported at 788 Bar.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.480
All nearby units,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.310
respond now.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.960
Over.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.550
Contact Mr. Han.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.520
Move!

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.280
Go!

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.160
Hurry!

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.200
Watch the steps!

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.080
Don't go in!

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.750
Police!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.480
Where is he?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.040
Still inside.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.640
But...

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.040
I don't know where exactly!

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.840
Excuse me.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.280
Come here.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.040
Come here.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.910
Where's he?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.430
Went that way.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.080
Get away!

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.990
Get away!

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.870
Get away!

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.960
Get away!

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.990
Why won't you leave me alone?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.430
My friend!

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.600
Come down.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.110
Come down. It's dangerous.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.670
Come on, get down.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.550
Let's talk.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.990
Why am I here?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:37.870
Yeah.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.630
Come here.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.150
Come on.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.110
It's me.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.920
Your friend. Come over here.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:47.560
Yeah, come here.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.150
Nice and slow.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.390
You can tell me anything.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:54.920
Come here.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.920
Be careful.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.840
Go!

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.480
What's going on?

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.110
Ms. Zhu,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.800
stabbing reported upstairs.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.230
We're evacuating

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.750
the crowd.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.390
Let me go!

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.150
Here!

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.560
Over here, everyone!

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.630
Mr. Han!

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.110
Su!

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.080
Coming through!

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.990
Sorry!

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:31.870
Coming through!

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.560
Help me.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.920
Please don't let go.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.110
I don't want to die.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.320
Let go!

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:55.840
Come help!

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.270
Let me go!

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.560
Let me go!

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.510
Mr. Han.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.320
Stay back! Don't move forward!

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:16.960
Stay back!

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.990
Doctor!

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.680
Doctor!

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.270
Are you okay?

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:27.920
Doctor,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.990
is he fine?

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.920
He's unconscious, but breathing.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.270
Wan.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.440
How's he?

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.840
Unconscious.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.750
Still has a pulse.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.080
We need to get him to a hospital.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.390
What's the situation?

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.840
Morning.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.080
All healed up?

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.750
Took a hit?

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.480
Caught an armed robber.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.390
Zhang,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.680
take him in.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:06.270
Okay.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.750
Sallow face. Bad teeth. Frostbite.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.200
He's looking at serious time.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:17.960
That's pure Narcotics skill.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.390
You've fully recovered?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.320
Yeah, I'm fine now.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.990
Well, we've got a new case.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.270
Get on it now.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.350
Okay.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.110
I have a question.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.750
Was there another reason

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.350
for coming back this time?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.270
Just wanted a new environment.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.680
Fine.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.510
Do a good job.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.750
I will.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.110
Mr. Gao,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.350
Mr. Bai said

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.720
our new forensics chief

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.480
is arriving today.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.440
He's probably almost here.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.480
Hello.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.200
Hello.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.270
I'm the new forensics chief,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.030
Qi Sizhe.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:39.390
Hi,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.350
I'm Gao Yuan.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.720
Hello, Mr. Qi.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.960
I'm the forensic intern,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.510
Qiu Lanzi.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.600
Do we have the blood sample

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.630
of the man

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.560
who fell from 788 Bar

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.560
last night?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.800
Just arrived.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:52.560
Can I see it?

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.920
Sure. Let's go.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:56.200
This way.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.200
Li Yiqi.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.030
32 years old, from Li City.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.270
He was in compulsory rehab for drug use.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.320
Three months ago,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.150
he came to He City.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.320
We interviewed

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.350
the witnesses

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.560
last night.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.680
None of them knew him.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.920
And they didn't know

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.990
why he attacked anyone.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.560
This appears

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.440
to be a random act of violence.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.390
We can only

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.030
figure out why once he's up.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.560
Xi,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.600
pull up the footage from the stairwell

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.110
to the roof.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.680
Yes.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.390
What's he doing?

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:34.750
Out of his mind?

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.480
Did he see something?

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.230
He's totally out of it.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.110
Talking to himself.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.200
Classic signs of being wasted.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:43.460
Xi,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.270
roll the video I sent you.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.510
This is Li Yiqi about 30 minutes

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.870
before the attack.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.920
Are they making some kind of deal?

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.800
Well, stop.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.870
I arrested

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.200
this guy

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.720
during a drug bust in Biannan.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.110
He's Jiang Fei,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.800
a drug dealer.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:28.560
Gao Yuan.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.030
Let me handle the blood sample.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.510
Okay.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.270
Mr. Han,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.390
can I ask

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.720
where you got those videos?

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:43.630
No.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.350
I've been here three months

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.150
and met quite a few people.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:51.600
Yeah.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.800
Any method's fine,

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.920
if it solves the problem.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.510
Right, we're just solving...

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.270
Why are you here?

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.160
Are you Ms. Zhu?

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.320
I just started

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.080
as the new forensics chief here.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.080
I'm Qi Sizhe.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:19.840
Hello,

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.040
I'm Zhu Qingyue.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.720
I've heard a lot about you.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.040
Li Yiqi's blood composition

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.400
needs further comparison.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.400
One moment, please.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.520
Alright.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.040
Then I'll come later.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.560
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.200
Mr. Han!

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.870
I traced Wang Qiang's network.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:53.990
He might know

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.150
Jiang Fei.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.230
Let's go.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.800
Sir,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.720
I've told you everything.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.080
I'm just a user.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.800
This isn't my first time anyway.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.110
Do what you gotta do.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.270
Is that your final answer?

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.800
Heroin, Ketamine,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.030
Meth, and Ecstasy.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.680
Sir,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.480
I can't afford those.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.720
I usually just get some...

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.480
fuel.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.720
For relief.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.840
Fuel?

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.920
Weed.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.320
Can't afford those.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.630
So you resort to armed
assault and robbery?

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.320
No, sir.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.870
All that was just

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.680
to get fuel.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.390
I only do that

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.440
when I'm broke.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.270
Do you know him?

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.990
He's a dealer.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.510
And you? Are you involved too?

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.150
Are you two partners?

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.630
How long have you been dealing?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.320
When did it start?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.030
I just use drugs.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.920
I'm just a user, not a dealer.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.440
This guy...

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.390
Jiang Fei.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.480
What Jiang Fei did

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.790
has nothing to do with me.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.400
I've never been involved

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.680
with his business.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.790
Really, sir.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.550
How do you know his name?

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.270
Where does he live?

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.990
Mr. Qi,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.340
here are

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.360
Li Yiqi's drug test results.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.680
We tested for everything

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.340
on the list.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.100
Li Yiqi is clean.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:28.720
Raw Diamond.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.270
Was it tested for?

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.310
Raw Diamond...

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.310
Here.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.590
Years ago, Raw Diamond was listed

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.680
as a major target.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.790
It's on the list too.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.270
The result was also negative.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.200
Mr. Qi,

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.880
are you suggesting

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.270
Li Yiqi was using Raw Diamond?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.590
But that case

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.510
was closed, wasn't it?

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.270
I heard the ringleader was shot dead.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.200
The urine test is back. It's positive.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.120
Thanks.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.640
Oh, Ms. Zhao,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.070
I'd like to ask you something.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.030
What is it?

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.360
Do you

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.160
know of any substances

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.120
that can cause

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.160
hallucinogenic effects?

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.480
A drug dealer?

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:15.830
Still investigating.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.920
Have you heard of a drug

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.830
called Raw Diamond?

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.120
Raw Diamond?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.720
Yeah.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.400
I heard

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.230
our bureau

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.270
made a huge push years ago

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.680
to wipe it off the streets.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.200
Raw Diamond

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.920
causes severe brain damage.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.920
And it can trigger hallucinations

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.160
that lead to violence.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.790
Many deaths I've examined

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.720
were linked to it.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.510
The last case I remember

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.120
was a 17-year-old girl.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:43.510
Raw Diamond made her

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:44.510
suffer brain damage

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.510
and become vegetative.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.400
From my experience over the years,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.200
Raw Diamond

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.230
is the most dangerous hallucinogen.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.400
Jiang Fei lives here?

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.550
Be careful. Drug dealers are desperate.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.230
Jiang Fei

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.510
has multiple hideouts.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.830
But which one he's in exactly...

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.550
You'll have to

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.590
find that out yourselves.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.830
No known drugs

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.400
in Li Yiqi's system.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.310
Finding Jiang Fei is the only way

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:37.990
to know

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.830
his connection

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.720
to this case.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.230
We've found Jiang Fei.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:06.750
Mr. Han,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.640
the Forensics Team collected

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.990
many partial and smudged prints.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.360
Looks like

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.590
most are just routine traces.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.830
All the data's here.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.270
Mr. Qi,

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.200
over here.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.310
Mr. Qi.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.400
What's the status?

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.120
Skin wrinkling on extremities,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.550
probably due to soaking.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.790
But with the bathtub there,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.360
water at the bottom is normal.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.070
I've checked the entire body.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.790
No obvious trauma.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.270
Mr. Qi,

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.480
with no trauma,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.680
can you determine the cause?

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.590
My initial assessment is

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.120
severe intoxication

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.920
and a disulfiram-like reaction,

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:19.230
causing respiratory depression,

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.030
seizures,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.270
cardiac dysfunction,

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.230
likely

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.270
with shock,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.990
and resulting in acute
heart failure and death.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.920
Cephalosporins and alcohol,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:30.920
a fatal mix.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.160
So it's an accidental death.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.990
Yes, for now.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.200
However,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.680
the exact cause

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.830
can only be confirmed

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.480
after the autopsy.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.480
Gao Yuan,

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.550
send the body to the bureau.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:45.880
I'll do the autopsy.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:46.640
Okay.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.480
Qi Sizhe.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.360
You requested a transfer here.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.070
What's your purpose?

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.440
And you, Han Feng?

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.070
You suddenly moved from Narcotics

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.990
to detective work.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.790
Why?

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.720
Jiang Fei may have multiple residences.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.030
Wan.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.990
Go to Kundu again.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.400
See if anyone has seen him.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.750
Okay, I'll change and head out.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.270
Xi,

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.640
track Jiang Fei's recent movements.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.640
Last two days especially.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.830
Keep me posted.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:04.310
Got it.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:25.990
Ms. Zhao,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.680
I'll leave the tox screen

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.070
to you.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.230
Thanks to you,

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.310
my workload

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.310
will be much lighter,

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.660
and I'll have fewer late nights.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.480
Thanks.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.440
Appreciate it.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.680
I'll go organize the drug samples.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.640
Mr. Qi,

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.880
I'll go prepare

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.920
the body storage unit

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.550
and fill out

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.310
this report.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.310
I'll handle the autopsy report.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.680
You store the body.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.550
Alright.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:54.830
Mr. Qi,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.310
I'll document the scene

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.510
and send the body later.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.480
Okay.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:30.270
Mr. Han,

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.030
are you investigating
Jiang Fei over Li Yiqi

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.480
or over his own dealing?

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.640
When I was in Narcotics in Biannan,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.590
he was dealing.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.360
And he got away during a bust.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.550
Now he's still dealing.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.270
I want to catch him myself.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.160
I feel like

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.960
he's connected to Li Yiqi.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.590
But you should know,

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.640
if Jiang Fei really died accidentally,

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.960
his case

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.200
has nothing to do

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:53.880
with us.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.120
This notebook

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.920
has to go to Narcotics.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:58.990
Fine. I know.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.880
Jiang Fei's autopsy is complete?

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:20.720
Mr. Han.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.360
Jiang Fei's body...

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:24.790
What's wrong?

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.270
Any findings?

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.440
No... Nothing found.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.680
I'm off duty, Mr. Han.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.590
I'm leaving.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.200
Mr. Han.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.030
Have you ever encountered a case

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.510
that involves someone around you?

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.030
I'm a cop.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.230
Whoever I'm investigating,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.310
I'll do my job.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.230
Who were you working with just now?

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:03.830
What's on your mind?

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.880
No. Nothing at all.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.880
I'm going, Mr. Han.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.790
Hasn't Gao Yuan always been
the one handling the reports?

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:38.960
Answer me.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.830
This is the Forensics Lab.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.880
I'm the forensics chief.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.070
Can't I handle the reports?

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.400
Qi Sizhe,

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.310
you can fool others,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.160
but not me.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.230
Why did you request a transfer here?

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.590
What about you?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.790
Han Feng.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.590
Hello?

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:16.750
Ms. Zhu,

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:17.920
got something on camera.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.880
Come take a look.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.270
Well, I'll be right there.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.070
Mr. Han,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.550
got something on camera.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.680
Let's go take a look.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.070
Hello? Ms. Zhu.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.680
Where are you?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.470
I...

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.510
I want to tell you something.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.120
About Jiang Fei's body.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.750
Okay.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.990
Mr. Han and I will be

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.640
at the Forensics Lab in ten minutes.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:52.990
Alright.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.550
Ms. Zhu, Mr. Han,

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.880
I spotted a suspicious person

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.830
near Jiang Fei's place.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.680
This person was tailing Jiang Fei

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:02.720
all the way to his place.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.750
We also checked that bar's footage

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.590
from that night.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.480
This person was there too.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:08.920
Play it.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.160
Hui, roll the bar's footage.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.480
Can you zoom on the face?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.880
One moment.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.680
Sorry.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.360
Really sorry.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:44.920
Mr. Qi.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.550
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.880
I have something to do.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.480
I'm going.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:49.960
Never mind.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.440
Qiu Lanzi.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:31.920
Qiu Lanzi.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:34.310
Qiu Lanzi?

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:35.990
Lanzi?

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.230
Lanzi?

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.030
She's dead.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.480
Mr. Han.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.920
Have you ever encountered a case

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.400
that involves someone around you?

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.400
Can't I handle the reports?

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:55.720
You requested a transfer here.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.030
What's your purpose?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.590
Go.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:48.790
Han Feng?

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:50.480
What do you want?

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.750
You're suspected of
murdering Qiu Lanzi.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.270
Come with me.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.150
A murder in our bureau is unprecedented.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.710
We must solve it quickly.

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:33.990
We owe the public answers.

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.760
Qi Sizhe is our colleague.

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.360
Do you have any concrete leads?

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.880
If not,

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:43.360
you can't just point fingers.

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:48.070
Footage from near Jiang Fei's residence

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.070
and 788 Bar

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.550
shows Mr. Qi

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.880
was present at the scene.

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:56.990
What else?

00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.480
Qiu Lanzi called me

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.800
before she died.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.320
Hello? Ms. Zhu.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:03.920
Where are you?

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.630
I... I want to tell you something.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.990
About Jiang Fei's body.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.510
Our bureau's camera shows

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.480
the last person Qiu Lanzi saw

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:13.670
was Qi Sizhe.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.750
Han Feng.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.320
What's your idea?

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.510
I agree with Ms. Zhu.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.880
I saw Qiu Lanzi before she died.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.510
She seemed disturbed.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.280
Mr. Han.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.150
Have you ever encountered a case

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.670
that involves someone around you?

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:41.990
What's on your mind?

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.510
No. Nothing at all.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.990
You think this is related to Qi Sizhe?

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.960
If the cases of Li Yiqi and Jiang Fei

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.150
are connected to Qi Sizhe,

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.360
then what could Qiu Lanzi have found

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.320
on Jiang Fei's body

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.880
that would push Qi Sizhe to kill her?

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.590
We must apply the law

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.760
fairly and justly to everyone.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:09.710
Don't worry, Mr. Bai.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.590
The evidence will speak.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.860
If you watched the camera,

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:16.150
you'd know

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.590
I'm not the killer.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.240
Why go to Jiang Fei's home?

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.630
You were there when
Li Yiqi attacked someone.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.480
And you went to see him at the hospital.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.150
Why?

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.550
I was studying

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.070
the city's trouble spots.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.400
Because I'm not just
a forensic examiner.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.030
I'm also a cop.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.030
Do you think

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.110
we would believe that?

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:48.340
Yeah, Han Feng.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.110
When have you ever believed me?

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.760
Li Yiqi,

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:02.480
Jiang Fei,

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.630
and Qiu Lanzi.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.990
You appeared before
each of their deaths.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.240
How do you explain it?

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.070
A coincidence?

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.320
Do you find it credible?

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.840
Tell me Lanzi's cause of death,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.320
and I'll explain.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.400
Is this when you switched

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.760
Qiu Lanzi's water bottle?

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.920
Gao Yuan's preliminary finding

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.110
is that Qiu Lanzi died
from potassium cyanide.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.990
Your prints are on this bottle.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.070
Explain this.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:47.670
Sorry.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.150
Between her picking up the bottle

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.240
and us finding her body,

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.320
only three minutes passed.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.630
You suspect I poisoned the water?

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.670
Was the water tested?

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.360
Was cyanide found?

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:21.590
Get your facts straight.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:23.710
We're questioning you.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.240
Don't tell us how to do our job.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.030
Before the autopsy report

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.920
and lab results are back,

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.480
we have nothing to say.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:46.240
Fine.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.480
We'll wait for the results.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.990
Mrs. Qiu, sorry for your loss.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.550
Rest assured. We will find the killer.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.400
Well, leave it to me.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.280
Mr. Han.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.400
Qiu Lanzi did die
from cyanide poisoning.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.510
But no cyanide was
detected in that water.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.070
And no cyanide was found

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.440
in Mr. Qi's belongings.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.550
The results are in.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.510
Qiu Lanzi died from potassium cyanide.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.480
She only contacted you
before she was poisoned.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:14.990
Explain that.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.550
And that water?

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.030
Any cyanide?

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.590
You found my prints on the bottle,

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.100
so you suspect I laced
the water with cyanide

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.630
and switched the bottles,

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.670
causing Lanzi to drink it and die.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.280
But you found no cyanide

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.240
in the water,

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.360
in my belongings,

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.480
or anywhere near Lanzi.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.320
So

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.190
your conclusion isn't
backed by any evidence.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.150
But as a medical examiner,

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.710
you'd have plenty of
opportunities and methods.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.110
Potassium cyanide is deadly.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.590
One touch is lethal.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.760
If I poisoned Lanzi,

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.480
there are only two ways.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.150
First,

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.360
I watched her

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.590
ingest the cyanide

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.550
and saw her die.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.360
But I wasn't in the bureau at the time.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.590
So that's impossible.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.320
Second,

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.400
I gave her food

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.590
laced with cyanide,

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.990
and she ate it the moment she walked

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:27.990
into the office.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:29.590
Then she died.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.550
By that logic,

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.320
it wouldn't just be me.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.800
Anyone in this bureau,

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.030
or even anyone she met

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.400
after she left here

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.480
could be the killer.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.070
A person dies from cyanide poisoning,

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.360
yet you can't determine

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.590
when or where the
cyanide was administered.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.880
Have you ever heard of

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880
remote investigation?

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.320
Even if you're not there,

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.670
the scene and the body

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:32.400
tell the whole story.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.480
Why did Qiu Lanzi take pictures

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.630
of Jiang Fei's body?

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.840
What did she discover?

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.920
Let me see Jiang Fei's autopsy report.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.510
You should step aside

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.800
from these two cases.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.320
We have other medical examiners.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.230
Not every case has to be handled by you.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.440
Do you really believe

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.510
I would kill a trainee

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.840
I barely knew?
