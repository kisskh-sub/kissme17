00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.799
What's going on?

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.799
My account was hacked.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.479
Not asleep yet?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.759
She knows it was me.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.119
Seems it was a bit obvious.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.880
You're not angry anymore, right?

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.119
Are you busy?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.159
Senior Lin Xiang.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.159
Do you need something, Senior?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.079
A little bit.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.599
But it's okay.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:15.400
Who hasn't made a mistake?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.920
As long as you can change, it's fine.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.680
Get some rest early.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.159
I have some confusion about relationships.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:25.560
And I don't know who to talk to about it.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.079
Tell me about it.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.680
I'm on a break right now.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.560
I...

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.760
Don't want to rest.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760
Want to chat with you.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.640
Why?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.640
I broke up.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.640
She fell in love with someone else.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.640
Because...

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.799
I like chatting with you.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.400
I quite like it too.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.680
How about...

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.960
We have a drink together?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.000
Chat while we drink.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.000
She...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.879
She's not about to confess to me, is she?

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.159
What are you doing?

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.199
Water is good.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.560
Water is healthy.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.120
You have something on your mind?

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.479
Since the other person has already left,

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.520
don't overthink it.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.879
Cheers.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.080
Why do you want to...

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.719
chat online?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.479
I seem to be a very nostalgic person.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.199
It's hard to forget the past and start over.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.959
It's the same for everyone.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.639
I often think of the time in the art studio.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.160
Online...

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.920
makes me feel a bit more secure.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.000
What a strange woman.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.800
You...

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.920
are a bit...

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
cute.

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.680
After all these years,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.199
you're still just as understanding.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.839
Easy to handle.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.920
I like...

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:05.279
listening to music?

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.759
It's okay.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.519
Do you remember this song?

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:17.480
We used to listen to it often in the art studio.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.680
Do you like cheek-to-cheek dance?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.959
I really like it.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.759
How about...

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.480
asking the senior out?

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:38.959
It's just dancing, right?

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:53.040
What's gotten into this guy?

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.120
You told me

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.040
to be a bit braver,

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.759
to face my feelings honestly,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.680
and to boldly speak my mind.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:06.959
How do you know

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.600
what I'm hesitating about?

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.920
Thank you.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.839
I think I know

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.000
what I should do.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.480
Do you love watching movies?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.759
Of course.

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.120
I'll treat you to a movie.

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.879
Or else...

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.879
I'll treat you to a movie.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.360
Okay.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.160
Actually, let me treat you.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.000
Book out a whole theater for tomorrow.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.319
Haven't you always said

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.920
watching movies is a waste of time?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.519
Is the film industry a sunset industry?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.519
What's up?

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.639
I feel like wasting some time.

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:36.279
I have an important arrangement.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.439
Alright.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.920
Understood.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.920
Let me tell you one more time.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.800
When I make this gesture,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.319
set off the fireworks.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:50.839
Got it?

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.920
Got it.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.079
When I do this,

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.600
bring out the flowers and gifts.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:57.319
Understand?

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:58.439
Don't worry, sir.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.240
Go on.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.759
Okay.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:04.959
Wen Pei'an.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.680
What a coincidence.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.120
You're here to watch a movie too?

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:14.439
Still playing hard to get with me?

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.759
Yeah.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.199
What a coincidence.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.279
But your sense of humor needs work.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.199
This is my senior, Lin Xiang.

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.079
Xin Tong, you've met her.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.399
A-Wen.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.800
A-Wen.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.279
You even...

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:32.720
brought someone.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.679
What else?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.039
I thought it was that kind...

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.559
traditional kind of date.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.600
It is quite traditional.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.360
It's about time.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.440
Shall we...

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:46.399
go in first?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.879
You don't need to buy tickets.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.600
I booked out the entire theater.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.000
I saw the trailer before,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.919
and thought...

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.320
this movie looked pretty good.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.200
Your friend has good taste.

00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:07.960
This movie has very high ratings.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:10.720
What are you doing?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.399
What were you thinking?

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:15.039
Inviting your senior over?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.279
This is my privacy.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.240
You have no right to interfere.

00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:26.360
But I really don't understand your behavior.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.919
I invited my senior to watch a movie.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.120
What's so hard to understand?

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.759
Why watch it with three people?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.159
Don't you think it's weird?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.799
I think it's very weird.

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:37.320
Yeah.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:38.639
Isn't this what you requested?

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:40.120
When did I request that? Just now.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.639
Very strongly.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:47.159
Today is very important to me.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.320
You know what?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.039
Today...

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.120
for me...

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:55.879
is also very important.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:01.519
Wen Pei'an

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:03.240
What's wrong?

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:05.000
Right now, you

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:07.000
your whole self

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.080
is radiating a kind of

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:10.519
glow.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:18.879
Thanks for the compliment.

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:21.440
You really have no perception.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.559
Who's complimenting you?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.240
Xin Tong,

00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:29.879
your friend still hasn't moved on?

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:33.360
Well...

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:34.919
You should be able to understand.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.000
You could say he and I are in the same boat.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.679
Didn't you say

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:50.480
today was Wen Pei'an's confession day?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.039
Why are there three people?

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.840
I don't know.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.279
Look.

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:02.879
What are you guys doing here?

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:04.519
On such a special day,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.840
how could I not be here?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.600
You are...

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.480
Qixing?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.120
And this is?

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.440
Hello, I'm Lin Xiang.

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:14.240
I follow your account.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.360
I hope our Lin Group

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.840
will have a chance to work with you.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.240
Hello, I'm family.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.000
Pleased to meet you.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.360
What does she even mean?

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:41.720
What's going on?

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.960
It seems

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:45.919
today isn't suitable for a confession.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.360
Xin Tong,

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.960
what kind of person are you, really?

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:51.960
My understanding of you

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.600
is far too little.

00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.440
Thanks for booking the place today.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.200
My senior and I have another

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.159
art exhibition to see.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:00.759
So we'll be leaving first.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.279
We should still have time, right?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.960
There's time.

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:05.720
Then let's go.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:07.480
Let's go.

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:07.840
Go.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.519
Who's confessing to whom here?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.039
You need to be braver.

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.519
Face your feelings honestly.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:31.320
Speak your mind boldly.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.679
I hope you understand.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.919
Of course I understand.

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:51.039
Thank you.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.879
Thank you for letting me be brave and be myself.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:12:59.519
Senior,

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:03.360
actually, I...

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.320
Actually, I've liked you for a long time.

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:17.759
Thank you.

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:19.399
But I think

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:22.080
we need to get to know each other better.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.200
That's okay.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.200
But I'm willing to accept your affection.

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:00.559
Then we'll

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.600
be off now.

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.480
Thanks for the flowers.

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:13.039
I didn't expect you to help others find happiness.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.759
Maybe this is love.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.679
They're quite a good match.

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:20.799
Bro, why do you look pale?

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:24.720
Your hands are ice cold.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.080
Should we go see a doctor?

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:28.159
Do I?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:31.759
Let's go.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.120
Why are you back so late?

00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:51.519
Are you crazy?

00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:55.519
Why aren't the lights on if you're home alone?

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.480
What did you mean by what you posted on Little Blue Book?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.639
What do you mean, what?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.080
My account was hacked days ago.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.080
I'm applying to get it back now.

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:07.960
Was

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.639
hacked?

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:12.879
The Coco account?

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:13.480
Yeah.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.120
You know about that account?

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.159
What did you mean by what you just said?

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:20.320
Which one of my

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.720
Little Blue Book posts?

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.759
Nothing.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.279
Just curious.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:32.840
Brother,

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.879
I'm sorry.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.320
Something happened at home today,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320
so I couldn't make our date.

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:38.240
My grandpa was in a car accident and is hospitalized.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.360
He urgently needs money for treatment.

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:41.399
But I don't have enough on hand.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.039
What's wrong with you?

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.080
It's nothing.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.759
My, uh...

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.039
My friend's grandpa

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.440
was in a car accident.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.879
Is it serious?

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.200
What do we do now?

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:03.480
Transfer money for treatment.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.600
You're pretty good to your friend.

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:17.960
I finally got my account back.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.879
Little Blue Book has been fully acquired.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.279
The chat records you requested

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.240
have also been completely deleted.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.159
Our group has nothing to do

00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:30.200
with this app.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.080
Why did you buy it?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.679
You found the hacker, right?

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:36.960
We've already confirmed their IP address.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.639
Good.

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:40.840
Call the police.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:41.799
Arrest them.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:43.720
Scamming five hundred thousand

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:44.840
is an amount

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.240
especially huge.

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:48.639
He won't get out in under five years.

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:49.759
You...

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.559
You didn't transfer the money to him on purpose, did you?

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.639
Am I that bored?

00:16:56.159 --> 00:16:57.559
And you couldn't possibly be that stupid.

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:06.160
Having an opponent makes it more interesting.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.119
Lin Xiang.
