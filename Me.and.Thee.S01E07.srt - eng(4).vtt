00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.300
What are you thinking?

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.250
I want to kiss you again.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.350
But I want this to be a kiss
you’re willing to allow.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.780
I didn’t see anything.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.920
Why are you here?

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.760
Do you think you’re the only one
getting interrupted?

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.640
Get ready.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.660
Starting tomorrow,
I’m going full force in chasing you.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.270
It really suits you.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.030
You took so many photos of me in secret.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.120
You’re just…

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.700
so madly in love.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.930
THE DARKROOM PURCHASE CONTRACT
HAS BEEN FINALIZED, MR. THEE.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.600
Power of attorney for land and building
ownership transfer.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.400
Gosh, Mr. Thee!

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.890
-(Good mor—)
-Are you crazy?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.260
(Can't you discuss things with me
before you do anything?)

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.180
What do you mean you bought that
entire building and transferred it to me?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.860
It’s not like it costs five or ten baht.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.940
The land alone is worth
hundreds of thousands,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.450
not to mention the equipment in the shop.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.820
What you did isn’t funny.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.420
Where would I find the time
to look after that building?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.500
Working for ARSENI alone
is already costing me sleep.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.060
This is not funny.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.450
I have my reasons.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.780
(What reasons?)

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.970
Tell me.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.450
That place is full of our memories.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.100
I don’t see
why I shouldn’t want to keep it.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.380
That’s not enough reason.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.210
But…

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.700
(I really can’t accept it.)

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.500
It’s too much.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.240
Fine.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.450
Transfer the place to ARSENI instead

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.600
and have our team manage it.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.500
Yes, Boss.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.150
But Peach gets to use it
for free for life.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.300
Let’s talk later.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.400
Someone’s calling me.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.930
When will Peach finally realize

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.700
that my money could really
stack up into a wall?

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.700
Hello?

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.670
(Are you free tomorrow afternoon?)

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.630
(Let’s grab a meal.)

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.450
Actually, let’s wait until
your boss is back from Japan, Mim.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.700
Then we can set up a meeting.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.740
(You really don’t want to see me, huh?)

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.150
It’s not like that.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.150
I just don’t want to waste your time.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.150
We’re only going to
talk about work anyway, right?

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.650
(Up to you then.)

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.140
Besides, I have a meeting tomorrow
that runs until early evening.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.290
(Really?)

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.600
(Let me text you some other time.)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.340
The Shohei family reached out.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.530
They want to meet with you, Mr. Thee.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.640
Who?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.570
They’re ARSENI’s arms-dealing partner

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.900
and a major client of Master.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.500
They have influence in Japan.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.030
Their youngest son is entering
the business scene in Thailand,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.850
so they want to get to know you.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.030
That won’t be necessary.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.570
You know ARSENI here
isn’t like my dad’s territory.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.630
I don’t sell guns.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.900
Shit!

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.550
It’s me, Plub.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.570
Plub!

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.300
What happened to you?

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.660
Why did you come back like this?

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.260
I can’t take it anymore.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.630
Trend is better at his job now,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.800
but helping him get there means
I haven’t had time to do my own work.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.260
You think you won’t be able to
edit all the photos in time, right?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.830
Go take a shower and sleep.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.370
I’ll take care of the rest.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.930
Really?

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.050
I want to give you my entire salary.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.000
But even if you did,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.980
I’d still have to take care of you,
wouldn’t I?

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.400
You know me so well.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.780
More like I see right through you.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.260
I don’t want to work anymore.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.840
Is your boyfriend rich?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.530
Can he take care of both of us?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.180
He’s not my boyfriend yet.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.300
Your boyfriend-to-be then.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.370
Is he rich?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.300
Well…

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.950
He has enough to get by.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.850
What?

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.020
Go take a shower and sleep
before I change my mind.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.980
If you do, I’m in trouble.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.400
I should go.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.200
Thank you, Peach.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.000
Don’t run. You don’t want to fall.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.100
He has enough to get by,
as in he’ll never run out of money.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.150
What are you doing at my house
so early in the morning?

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.100
You’re wearing something bizarre

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.260
and awkwardly in-between again.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.250
I wore this to sleep,

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.700
not to show off to anyone.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.420
Besides, you’re the only one who shows up
at my house this early in the morning.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.500
I’m the only one?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.450
Where are my slippers?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.600
They’re not yours. They’re Plub’s.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.190
Peach!

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.850
Shit!

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.909
I’ve already booked a ride.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.350
You can sleep in. No need to drive me.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.260
Hey! She’s really here this time.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.930
Go! Leave!

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.730
Go!

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.300
Oh.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.900
Why are you standing in front of the door?

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.450
Well, I heard you shouting,
so I opened the door for you.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.100
I didn’t make you breakfast, though.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.260
Can you grab something to eat
at the office?

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.800
Sure.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.200
My ride is here. I’m heading out.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.200
Wait.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.600
I’ll walk you out.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.150
Come on.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.100
Let’s go before you’re late.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.400
Bye.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.650
Bye.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.100
Hey!

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.200
We’re lucky Mr. Mok
didn’t park in front of the house.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.770
Otherwise, we’d be in trouble.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.330
Panachakorn and I have met before.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.850
Meeting at the house
and at the office are different.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.860
You’re making a mountain
out of a molehill.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.100
If Plub saw you at my house,
she’d die of shock.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.100
I mean, you even brought me breakfast.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.370
When are you going to tell Panachakorn

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.580
about us?

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.640
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.740
Plub is here!

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.140
You need to lie down.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.820
Lie down!

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.370
Luckily, I turned back in time.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.780
Why are you lying face down?

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.970
My back hurts.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.930
Oh, do you want me to walk on your back?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.500
Hey!

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.630
No, it’s okay.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.450
Your driver is waiting, right?

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.700
Alright. Sweet dreams, Lookpeach.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.200
Make sure you don’t forget anything else.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.100
Bye-bye.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.600
Lookpeach.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.300
Are you hungry?

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.270
(Lookpeach.)

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.330
(Lookpeach.)

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.010
(Why is my heart beating your name?)

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.130
Hey.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.210
(Lookpeach.)

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.000
(Get a grip.)

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:34.690
(Lookpeach.)

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:35.430
Hey.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.150
I’m going to take a shower.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.950
I’ll be right back.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.850
I can wait.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.850
I can wait my whole life.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.300
Mok, I need you to do something urgent.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.320
You have only 20 minutes.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.000
Hey!

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.370
What are you doing?

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.150
Do you like this?

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.340
Call me Peach.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.050
Lookpeach.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.700
Peach.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.450
Lookpeach.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.630
I said Peach.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.580
Lookpeach.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.700
I can pronounce the ‘ch’
more clearly if you want.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.560
Lookpeach.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.000
Smile, Lookpeach.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.140
Lookpeach.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:00.700
Peach.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.200
Lookpeach. Lookpeach.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:02.720
Lookpeach.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.800
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.860
Look…peach.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.430
Are you really not going to take that off?

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.400
Anyway, why are you here
so early in the morning?

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.430
Hmm? Don’t you have to go to work?

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.750
I came to pick you up.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.220
You have the Spring Project meeting today,
don’t you?

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.430
That’s at 2 p.m.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.110
I think I’ll take a nap before I go.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.220
You can go without me.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.350
I can wait.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.530
Mr. Thee.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.050
Don’t let me affect your work.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.650
You’re so strict.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.470
It’s time to go.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:50.400
Alright.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.670
There’s coffee in the fridge.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.690
You can have some when you wake up.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.250
Hold on.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.200
Are you really wearing that out?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:13.800
Hey.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.350
I’m returning it to its real owner.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.400
We’ll see each other in just a few hours.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.340
I pray my heart doesn’t break before then.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:37.950
Wait.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.800
Have a seat and wait a moment.
I’ll be right back.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.500
Here’s a souvenir for you.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.450
From where?

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.300
From our beach trip.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.800
On my first day there,
I went to a handmade market.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.700
I saw it and thought of you.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.380
You thought of me?

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.300
Can you stop picking up
only what you want to hear?

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.940
I said a lot more than that.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.350
I painted and glazed it,

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.700
so it needed time to dry.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.100
The shop had to send it to me later.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.850
I’m sorry I’m giving this to you so late.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.350
They say the sound of a wind chime helps
people calm down and collect themselves.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.300
I think it suits you.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.800
Try hanging it up.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.900
This has my name on it too?

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.300
I remember that everything that’s yours
has your name marked on it, right?

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.600
Everything that’s mine has
Theerakit K. Lee marked on it.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.500
I love it so much.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.450
Thank you, Look…

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.650
You’ve fallen asleep, Lookpeach?

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.400
Let your heart rest and your body recover.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.870
Sweet dreams, Lookpeach.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.250
That’s right.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.410
Everything that’s mine
has my name marked on it.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.250
The meeting room is ready.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.050
I need your advice, Mok.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:20.900
Of course, Boss.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.220
Where should I hang this?

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.100
If I hang it here, I won’t see it at home.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.500
But if I take it home,

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.800
what will I do at work?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.090
Why don’t you buy another one?

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.700
I didn’t buy this myself.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.600
Peach got it for me.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.300
Actually, this is much more special
than the squid he gave you guys.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.200
This clearly shows that, to Peach,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.460
I’m not just anyone.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:56.370
Let’s go to the meeting.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.540
My name is on this too.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.070
Peach said he painted it with his own hands.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.650
Boss—

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.340
Not only does he take beautiful photos,

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.800
but his handwriting
is also really beautiful.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.600
You can have a love life,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.460
but please don’t let it affect your work.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.800
I love it so much, Mok.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.400
I really love it.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.330
This has my name on it too?

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.850
I remember that everything that’s yours
has your name marked on it, right?

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.450
A wind chime should be hung up.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.550
Is it almost time
for the meeting with Peach?

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.520
You can’t ask the same question
every five minutes, Boss.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.080
He’s acting like a kid.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.300
What’s wrong, sis?
Why are you pacing around like that?

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.700
You’re going to end up
complaining about knee pain again.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:02.860
Didn’t the doctor say
they’re starting to wear out?

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.880
Mr. Mok told me the Spring Collection
meeting will be moved

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.930
to the large conference room.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.500
I’ll call and let Peach know.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.080
Isn’t the small meeting room available?

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.100
It is.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:12.850
Oh?

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.300
Then why don’t we use that room?

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.500
Because…

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.890
Boss is going to join the meeting.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:20.690
What?

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.940
Why are you walking around?

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.750
-Why?
-Why are you walking around?

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.600
I’m freaking out.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.690
Hey! Note!

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.900
Why are you following me?

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.080
Why are you walking around?

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.300
Well, I don’t know what to do.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.150
I’m stressed.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:40.640
Oh!

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:53.730
First of all,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.700
it’s such an honor to have you
join our update meeting, Boss.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.730
As the project lead,

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.700
shall I go ahead and give you an update?

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140
I guess that means I can start now.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.450
Spring is the third sub-project
of All Season’s One Word.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.020
For this one, our brand ambassador Aran
will be our main model as usual.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.060
However, from the special-scent release
for the Fall Collection,

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.360
we saw higher sales
when we used two models.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.270
So we’re currently looking for

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.650
another model who’s trending right now
to shoot with Aran.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.780
Once we find the person,
we’ll let you know right away, Boss.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.970
Mm.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.400
There’s one more change
from the last project.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.500
For this one, Peach is back
as our main photographer.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.050
Trend will be his assistant.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:05.990
Is an assistant really necessary?

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.350
Uh…

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.200
Shall I start proposing my ideas?

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.870
Yes, that’d be great.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.050
Since the concept
of this collection is “Spring,”

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.200
I want to highlight nature.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.370
So I’m proposing that
we don’t shoot in the studio.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.200
Let’s shoot outdoors.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.050
THE ONE AND ONLY TH -
YOUR OUTFIT IS REALLY CUTE TODAY.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.960
Agreed.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.120
Your ideas are amazing.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.200
I like them.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.200
Would you like to have dinner tonight?

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.800
What did I present?

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:18.900
Can you give me a recap?

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.800
See? You weren’t even listening to me.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.170
You were just staring at my face
in the meeting room.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:27.700
Don’t do that.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.850
Your work will suffer.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.100
Besides, the others might get suspicious.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.930
Okay.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:38.600
So what do you want to eat for dinner?

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.400
Anything is fine,
but let’s keep it simple.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.690
SEE YOU AT 7 P.M. AT YOUR FAV PLACE,
JUST IN CASE YOUR MEETING RUNS LATE.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.020
Mr. Thee…

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.300
I already had Mok book a restaurant.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.300
Whose car should we take?

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.740
Mine or yours?

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.300
I don’t think I can make it anymore.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.550
Be reasonable.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.190
But you gave me your word.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.900
I’m sorry.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.290
I mixed up the date.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:29.330
Mm.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.600
I have a work meeting,

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.850
but ours is just dinner.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.250
We can always reschedule.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.660
As you wish.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.370
I’ve explained myself,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.450
so I’m not going to beg you.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.500
I thought you’d already left.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.500
Do you want to talk to me about something?

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.550
But Boss seemed to like
your presentation earlier.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.070
What’s wrong?

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.050
When it comes to love,

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.050
should we rely more on reason or feelings?

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.000
Why do you ask?

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.000
What’s going on?

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.800
Well…

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.400
I forgot I had a work meeting
this evening,

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.700
so I’d already agreed
to have dinner with him.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.750
When I realized I couldn’t make it
and explained,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.500
he got mad at me.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:45.900
And then?

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.500
Nothing.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.600
I just don’t understand
why he doesn’t understand.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.130
Hmm…

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.380
When someone’s already made plans

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.700
and they fall through,

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.500
it’s normal for them to feel disappointed.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.400
I don’t think he’s mad at you.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:04.650
He might just be sulking.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.700
What should I do?

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.150
Hmm… you need to weigh your options.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.000
Work is obviously more important.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.100
No, I mean you should think about

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.500
which plan you can ditch
without regretting it later.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:30.780
And to answer your question about whether
love requires more reason or feelings,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.900
if you ask me,

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.370
I’d say I lean a bit more toward feelings.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.100
Why?

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.550
Because love is about feelings.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.800
Because you feel, you love.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:28.500
What is it?

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.250
Why do you keep biting your lip?

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.250
Hello, Mim.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.730
Sorry for calling on short notice.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.700
I misunderstood your message a bit.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.250
Can we postpone today’s plan?

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.480
Something urgent came up.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.850
I’ll take the job to make it up to you.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:04.700
Okay.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.570
See you soon.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.600
Now I’m free this evening.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.200
Hey.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.450
Someone could walk in and see us.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.800
If anyone comes in right now,

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.170
I’ll have their eyeballs taken out.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.600
I have something to tell you.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.400
Actually, Mim isn’t just a friend.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.170
She’s my ex.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.000
But there’s nothing between us now.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:04.550
We just work together.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:08.220
Mm.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.250
I didn’t want you to find out later
or hear it from someone else.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.500
Are you okay with me working with my ex?

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.600
Of course. I trust you.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.410
If Mr. Peach finds out, won’t he get mad?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.570
I trust Peach,
but I don’t trust other people.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.750
Montpreeya.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.300
She dated Mr. Peach back in university.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.600
Based on the information we found,
she’s the ex who was with him the longest.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.690
Why did she reach out now?

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.500
She works as a secretary to an executive
at a newly launched entertainment company.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.800
They want Mr. Peach to join their project.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.390
I won’t allow it.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.450
Sir, Mr. Peach is a freelancer.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.800
You can’t meddle with his decision
to take a job or not.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:11.830
Who am I supposed to be

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.340
to cuddle with Peach?

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.340
“Meddle.”

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.050
That’s what I mean.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.700
Well, maybe someone Mr. Peach allows
to help him make decisions.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.650
Someone he allows to have the right

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.500
to be his other half.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.900
Buy that startup
and bring it under ARSENI.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.690
Replace both the executive
and the secretary.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.900
And Blacklist Peach’s name.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.450
I don’t think we can do that.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.400
If they find out ARSENI is behind it,
they’ll be even less likely to agree.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.200
Ms. Montpreeya’s boss is Mr. Tatsuya,

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.000
the youngest son of the Shohei family

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.100
whose appointment you just rejected.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.100
That family again?

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.420
What do they really want?

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.600
The Shohei family is an old yakuza family.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.600
They’re currently looking to expand
their power base into other countries.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.320
Mr. Tatsuya seems to have broken away
from his family to start his own business.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.200
He’s not under their control
like his siblings.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.700
He didn’t break away.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.170
He’s just chasing a shortcut.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.900
I’ll arrange a protection team
for Mr. Peach.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:38.300
Make sure Peach can live his life
as normally as possible.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.400
Do not let ARSENI affect his happiness

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.200
or smile.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:46.660
Got it.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.900
As for the heir of that Shohei family,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.920
I don’t trust him.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.950
If he really is taking the shortcut
we think he is,

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.500
he’ll know soon enough

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.300
who the king of this mountain is.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:27.700
Thank you.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.970
Do you like the atmosphere here?

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.400
I do.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.300
But I just want to come here to eat.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.100
I don’t want to own the place.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.750
Next time, you don’t have
to close it just for us.

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.550
Can I ask you something honestly?

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.100
I’m not being possessive or anything.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.600
Why do you still take on more jobs?

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.300
Is ARSENI paying you too little?

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:04.750
It’s not about the money.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:07.900
I do it because I love this job.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.200
Most people hate working.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.200
If they had a choice,

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.300
they’d just want to lie down
and do nothing.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.060
I’m not like the others.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.470
I’m where I am today because of my job.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.870
Mok said your key is in your car.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:44.100
Okay.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.300
Hurry and go inside.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.750
Thank you for today.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:52.650
The food was delicious.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.260
Good night.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.800
Let’s go together again sometime.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.100
Oh, hey.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.200
Tomorrow’s a day off. Are you free?

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.550
Why?

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.000
There’s somewhere I’d like to take you.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.170
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:18.500
Mr. Thee, this is Mother.

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:19.949
She’s the one who raised me.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.770
Come on in.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.980
The kids are just on break.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.100
They’ll be so happy to know
you and your friend came to visit them.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.730
Bring your friend inside.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.199
Let’s go inside.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.810
BAN KLAMAI PLAYGROUND

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.250
Marn has already moved out?

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:48.860
Yes.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.139
For about two weeks now.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:54.980
How’s Mork?

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.420
As you can see.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.800
The last time I saw him smile was
when he watched his sister get in the car.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.540
Since then, I’ve barely heard his voice.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.330
This is my friend Thee.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.150
Hi, Thee.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:20.400
How are you?

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.700
I miss my little sister.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.300
Once Marn gets settled in,
she’ll probably reach out.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.100
I’ve been waiting for her
to call me every day.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.010
I understand you, Mork.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:51.050
I really do.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.800
She’s happy there.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.000
She has a home and a room of her own.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.000
She has parents now.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.210
Honestly, I’m really happy for her.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.840
But I just miss her.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.900
Kids, it’s time to eat!

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.000
Do you want to eat with us, Peach?

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.200
You too, Thee.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.610
You go ahead.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.650
I’ll join you in a bit.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.500
Seeing Mork reminds me of
myself in the past.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.650
I’m sorry for catching you off guard.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.470
All the kids here…

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.600
They don’t have families?

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.380
Some are orphans.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:00.400
Some had families.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.450
Like me.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:03.750
What do you mean?

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:12.050
(Plub and I were sent here
because our family was abusive.)

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.700
(Our stepfather hurt us,)

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.100
(and our mom couldn’t do anything.)

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.050
Peach.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.600
Don’t be afraid.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.340
I’ll take care of you, Lookplub.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:24.980
Hi, sweeties.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.100
What are your names?

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.300
I’m Lookpeach.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.500
My sister is Lookplub.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.200
You’ve both been through a lot.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.700
From now on, let me take care of you.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.800
You used to be afraid of me.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.800
Is this part of the reason?

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.300
I’d never hurt you.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.700
I promise.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.500
I believe you.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.500
That’s why I brought you here.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:08.050
Are you okay?

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.500
I started working when I was 18,

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.570
so that one day, when Plub was old enough,

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.550
I could take her to live with me.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.370
Back then, she had to keep herself hidden,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.100
hoping no one would take a liking to her
and adopt her,

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:40.170
because I wasn’t qualified
to take her out yet.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.050
But in the end, we got to live together.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.870
I think that’s why I love being
a photographer.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.560
This is my real life.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.050
How do you feel after hearing that?

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.120
Are you tired?

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.250
You’ve done really well getting this far.

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.600
From now on, you won’t have to
struggle like that anymore,

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.900
because I’ll take care of you
and your sister.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.450
TWISTKO

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.300
This is yummy.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.240
I’m going to crush you to pieces!

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.670
Where are you going?

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.490
Where do you think you’re going?

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.300
This has been a really tiring day off.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.100
You were the kids’ favorite, though.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.550
Let’s go there together again.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.700
Let’s go often.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:54.900
Can I ask you something?

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.600
How did you feel being there today?

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:13.050
I’m grateful you introduced me
to your home.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:14.600
That’s all?

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.450
Actually, something’s been
weighing on my mind.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.300
What is it?

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.100
Who do I ask for your hand in marriage?

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.760
Hey.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.100
I’m serious.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.800
Can I ask your Mother?

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:46.650
Or…

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.950
Do I have to ask your sister?

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:50.860
Mr. Thee.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.500
What’s been stressing you out all day?

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.100
Are you afraid...

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.100
I’d mind that you grew up there?

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:14.950
I don’t want to think that way,

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.470
but I can’t help it.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:23.800
Knowing this makes me love you even more.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.300
It’s late. You should go.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.500
Can I…

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.700
stay here tonight?

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:56.900
Please?

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.050
But this place doesn’t have a bathtub,

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.800
or butlers, or anything like that.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.500
Just having you is enough.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.100
What do you think of my in-between outfit?

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.340
Is it comfortable to wear?

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.950
It’s not bad.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.200
-Mr. Thee.
-Peach.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:49.820
You go first.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.620
Thank you so much for today.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.420
I really like who you are today.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.100
I really like who I am today too.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.300
And I like you a lot.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:27.700
This is the first time
I’m looking at your face this closely.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:32.900
Your eyes are beautiful.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:39.500
Beautiful?

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.100
I’ve only ever been told they look scary.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.700
No, they’re charming.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:52.130
They’re yours.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:02.700
This is yours too.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.150
Mr. Thee.

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:07.400
Peach.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:13.500
How about we try dating?

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.400
What did you say?

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.550
I might be pretty busy with work,

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.450
but I promise I’ll take good care of you.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.900
Whatever you want to do,
wherever you want to go, just tell me.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:29.800
I’ll make it happen.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.100
If you like working,
I won’t get in your way.

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.900
I’ll let you live your life.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.350
And don’t worry.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.900
ARSENI won’t complicate your life.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.370
The world I’m about to build

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.450
will be just the two of us.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.460
Talk about a hard sell, huh?

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.200
We haven’t reached
the most important part.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:07.600
If you’re with me,

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:17.800
I swear I’ll love, take care of,
and protect you and your sister for life.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.290
How long will this honeymoon phase last?

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.670
For as long as I breathe.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:36.400
Intimidating?

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.750
Nah.

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.900
Hungry?

00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:58.890
I’m hungry.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:18.500
This is Mr. Touch.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.690
He’s my boss.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.700
Nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Peachayarat.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.100
I have one more thing to tell you.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.000
The Shohei family is no different from
my father’s Lee family.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.170
Mr. Touch is a mafia boss too?

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.900
Hey!

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:29.650
I know now why love is dangerous.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.200
I was never afraid of dying

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:32.330
until I fell in love with Peach.

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:33.300
Do you have any problem with this?

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.100
The problem is I’m stuck on you.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.180
Don’t forget that
others still don’t know about us.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.420
Peach!
