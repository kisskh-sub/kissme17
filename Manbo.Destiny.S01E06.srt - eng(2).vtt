=Episode 6=

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.039
Will you release him

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.359
if I become yours?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.359
Of course.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.450
I never lie to you.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.879
Mengmeng, are you all right?

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.039
Mengmeng.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.479
What's wrong?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.158
Have I met you

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:13.629
a long time ago?

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:16.839
Why do I

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:18.762
feel an unexplainable fear

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.262
whenever I see you?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.839
I guess you had a nightmare.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.479
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.599
Don't be afraid.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.239
Go and sleep on the bed.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.399
Will you release him

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.119
if I become yours?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.199
Of course.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.650
Mengmeng, what's wrong?

00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:10.479
Tonight...

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:14.839
Mengmeng.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.519
I'm yours.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.525
Mengmeng, what's wrong with you?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.719
Wait.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:33.634
Wait.

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:34.625
Guan Mengmeng.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.599
Guan Mengmeng, don't be reckless.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.119
Mengmeng.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.599
Your Majesty, forgive us!

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:45.799
I beg you.

00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:48.875
I beg you to let them go.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.679
They are the people closest to me.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.925
Hmph.

00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:55.586
The closest people to you?

00:03:56.412 --> 00:03:58.519
They can't even take good care of you.

00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.312
How are they closest to you?

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.900
No.

00:04:01.587 --> 00:04:02.346
No.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.839
Someone!

00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:06.910
Take them away

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.359
- and imprison them for life!
- Yes!

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.679
Your Majesty, spare us!

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.719
I beg you to let them go.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.279
You want me?

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.490
I'll give myself to you.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.959
I'll give myself to you.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.599
Don't you want me?

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.759
Now is the time.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.925
Wait, Mengmeng.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.679
Mengmeng, wait.

00:04:41.037 --> 00:04:41.669
Wait.

00:04:44.637 --> 00:04:46.012
Mengmeng, wake up!

00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:47.212
Mengmeng.

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:49.839
Mengmeng!

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.479
Mengmeng, wake up!

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.159
Mengmeng!

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.319
Mengmeng.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.079
Sorry.

00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:07.437
Was that really me just now?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.639
I treated you so cruelly?

00:05:23.187 --> 00:05:24.466
We are finally married.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.039
Second Prince,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.999
there's no need to be so serious.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.175
We're married in name only.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.119
What do you mean?

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.919
I don't love you.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.279
But...

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.495
You said you needed me

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:45.122
and begged me to marry you.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.175
Yes.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.159
I do need you.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.325
Don't you need me as well?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.919
Without me,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.608
how can you compete with Song Pai
for the position of crown prince?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.719
So, you've only wanted to use me.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.679
No.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.399
You want to win against Song Pai

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.599
and I want to become the crown princess.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.999
I'm not using you.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.375
We are just using each other

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.359
and getting what we need.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.999
Wen Shanna!

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.759
I'll tell you honestly.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.562
I only agreed to marry you

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.159
because I pitied you.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.160
I have a soft spot for women.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.199
Second Prince.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.362
I don't care why you pity me.

00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:41.641
I also don't care why you married me.

00:06:42.352 --> 00:06:43.642
But as long as I'm around,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.199
you will surely be the crown prince

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.559
because I will

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.439
surely become the queen.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.719
For your family

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.479
and your father,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.879
do you think it's worth it

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.439
for you to do this?

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.079
Sacrificing me alone

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:08.118
for my family's prosperity.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.919
It's a good deal

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.079
for me.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.529
A good deal?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.959
It's a good deal for other people.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.425
You should know
my brother's capabilities

00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:27.056
better than me.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.999
With the nutty Guan Mengmeng
by his side,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.862
your possibility
of becoming queen is minimal.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.479
That only means

00:07:40.762 --> 00:07:41.557
you

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:42.337
are

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:43.659
bad.

00:07:43.737 --> 00:07:44.376
You...

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.119
Will you be happy

00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:02.464
after becoming the queen?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.662
Mengmeng, wake up.

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:26.856
Mengmeng.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.719
(Seriously.
Is this real or is it a dream?)

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.198
Mengmeng.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.239
(He's so calm. Was that just a dream?)

00:08:46.487 --> 00:08:47.262
What's wrong?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.519
What is this?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.679
Take a look first.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.350
The e-commerce approval?

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.750
You got it done so quickly?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.690
Since the contract has been signed,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.469
I'll surely obey it.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.719
Then, what about my reward
for attending the wedding,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.759
one million Manbo Coins?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.639
Attend the wedding?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.479
That's your own wedding.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.494
I don't care.

00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:15.719
I was

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.872
a performance guest.

00:09:27.812 --> 00:09:30.062
(Transfer to Guan Mengmeng 1,500,000)

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.425
(Transfer Guan Mengmeng)

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.479
1.5 million?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.959
Didn't you say it was a million?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.279
The extra 500 thousand coins

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.250
was compensation

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.959
for last night.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.750
(Gosh, it wasn't a dream.)

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.800
You might be the one to act first,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.390
but I'm not someone
who takes advantage of people.

00:09:58.112 --> 00:09:58.679
Yes.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.159
I did act first.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.350
So, I should compensate you

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.559
instead of you compensating me.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.787
(Transfer to Song Pai 500,000)

00:10:10.912 --> 00:10:11.690
500 thousand coins.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.079
I've transferred it to you.

00:10:13.962 --> 00:10:14.519
No.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.250
I'll reject it.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.359
Stop.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.625
In that case,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.925
we'll compromise.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.039
Since we don't think
any of us are at a loss,

00:10:24.337 --> 00:10:25.119
why don't we

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.799
think of it as an accident?

00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:28.725
Yes.

00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:30.094
That was an accident.

00:10:31.287 --> 00:10:31.850
Sure.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.839
I'll listen to you.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.519
But I don't want your money.

00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:41.743
In that case,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.199
donate it.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.030
Think of it as the disaster relief fund.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.800
What do you think?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.959
I'll listen to you.

00:10:49.412 --> 00:10:50.200
Mengmeng.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.599
Later,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.159
I'm bringing you out.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.079
You should dress up.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.599
Going out again?

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.039
Why do royalties
have so many things to do?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.559
One hour.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.790
If you're late by a second,
your money will be deducted.

00:11:11.975 --> 00:11:14.314
What a stingy prince.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.130
When I take all your money,
I'll leave this place immediately.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.639
(Leave?)

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.199
(Dream on.)

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.612
(Hmph.)

00:11:29.232 --> 00:11:30.982
(Welcome Back Home)

00:11:31.687 --> 00:11:32.677
Don't open your eyes.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.650
Tada!

00:11:41.812 --> 00:11:43.350
(Welcome Back Home)

00:11:57.337 --> 00:11:58.725
Why are all of you here?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.519
Do you want a company without a team?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.879
I bought this building.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.599
From today onwards,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.679
this will be your permanent office.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.319
- Hello, Boss.
- Hello, Boss.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.359
Thank you, all of you.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.479
Did you

00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:26.544
do

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.719
all these?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.039
Did you bring all my friends here?

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.799
Of course.

00:12:32.787 --> 00:12:35.266
This is the surprise
our boss prepared for you.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.119
Our boss...

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.079
Enough.

00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:40.367
Are you satisfied?

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.599
Yes.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.079
I'm very satisfied.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.639
Everyone, thank you

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.399
for being willing to work with me again.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.359
Thank you.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.439
We should thank you instead.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.239
You still remember us
even after becoming the princess.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.319
Am I right?

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.719
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.719

We can work together again!

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.719
It's too early to be happy.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.439
Look at this first.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.079
What is this?

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.759
These are the projects
you developed in the past.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.599
And your former clients as well.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.759
I contacted all of them.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.525
They are willing

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.519
to work with you again.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.079
