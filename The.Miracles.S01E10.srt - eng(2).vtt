WEBVTT

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.439
My worst fear

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:54.799
has come true.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.240
But I didn't expect them to be so ruthless.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.680
The stock market shouldn't be a trap-filled casino.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:15.000
Look.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.799
A storm is coming.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.840
Coming, coming! Stop knocking!

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:31.560
Who is it?

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.200
What are you doing here?

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.239
Quick, quick, come in and sit.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.000
A Jie is in trouble.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.680
Trouble? What trouble?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.079
Don't play dumb with me.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.840
Wasn't it you who took him to the black market?

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.439
Thanks to your great introduction.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.239
He lost all the family's savings

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.959
and the money he borrowed.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.840
Where is he? Where is he now?

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.920
Where?!

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.200
He jumped off a building.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.520
From today on,

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.159
you are you, and I am me.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:50.599
I'm done.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.479
I sold the shop.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.159
Boss Wu.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.080
They're using computers now.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.360
It's clearly meant to keep us common folks

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.960
from understanding it.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.199
They say one thing to your face,

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.879
and another behind your back, to trick you.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.400
What?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.360
You're the one who says one thing

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.159
and does another.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.400
You're the one who ruined A Jie.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.280
He didn't have the luck for it.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.360
Don't blame me.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.680
Don't think I don't know.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.879
It's you who deliberately crash the price to buy low,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.400
then wait for the stock split to sell high.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.159
Let me tell you something.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.879
Don't talk nonsense without evidence, okay?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.319
Beat him up.

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.080
Who do you think you are?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.439
You're just a dog raised by the brokerage branch.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.759
Kick him in the mouth.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:30.879
Get him from over there.

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.879
Everything's been handled properly for you.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:36.800
Everything's been handled properly for you.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.800
Thanks to your brilliant planning,

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.279
we made another big profit.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.519
I heard

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:46.399
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange is really happening.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.240
Computerized matching is really coming.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.079
Some of our old clients

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.319
are getting tempted.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.639
To be honest with you,

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.519
I'm getting nervous too.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.360
The market is a stage.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.879
We set the scene and the lights.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.519
They perform and dream.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:06.199
Your job isn't to worry.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.639
It's to hold steady.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.279
Everyone says

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.360
your name, Boss Wu, is famous and powerful.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.079
You have to live up to that name.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.079
Yes, yes, yes.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:18.800
Thanks to you watching over me.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:21.600
I, this "Boss Wu," am just a front.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.040
You are the real Boss Wu.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.199
The doctors' consultation results...

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.040
The situation might not be optimistic.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.199
Wait a minute.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.959
I know who's behind this.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.720
Why do you meddle in so much?

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.720
Watch your own back.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800
Just shut up already.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:06.639
I wasn't talking about you.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:08.720
Alright, if there's nothing else, hang up.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.000
Mommy.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.360
I still want to buy a toy.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.600
We'll buy it.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.920
We'll buy whatever you want.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.439
Okay.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.199
Deputy Head Liang.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.199
Deputy Head Liang.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.920
Where's Head Yu?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.399
The leadership is here.

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:26.000
Head Yu is giving a report.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.959
How long has he been in there?

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.079
One hour and forty minutes.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.199
Head Yu! Head Yu!

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.279
How did it go, Head Yu?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.519
How many years have you all been in Shenzhen?

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.839
Three years for me.

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:48.600
A year and a half. One year.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Same year as him.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.759
One year. I'm also one year.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:52.639
Two years for me.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.519
I came to Shenzhen after graduation.

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:56.040
And you recruited me into the preparation team.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.959
I've been here for seven years.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.959
During these seven years,

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:02.600
I've been waiting for an answer.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.160
Comrades,

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.040
you must remember today.

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:11.040
Just now,

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:12.800
it has been decided

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.600
that the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.160
will, in 1990,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.199
on December 1st,

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.199
officially begin centralized trading.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.759
We did it! We did it!

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.279
Fantastic!

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.720
Thank you.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:31.639
Let's keep it up.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.519
December 1st.

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:34.600
Impossible.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.839
I'm exhausted from taking them to buy toys.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.439
There's a bag.

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:38.079
Later, you'll come with me

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:38.720
to buy it, okay?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.519
Buy what?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.399
A typhoon is coming.

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:41.399
Hurry through the checkpoint and go home.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.519
Make sure to double-check before hitting Enter.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.800
Buy orders on the left, sell orders on the right.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:48.879
Don't mix them up again.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.079
Alright, let's call it a day for now.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.120
Tomorrow,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.879
tomorrow we'll keep working hard.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:57.839
Go on home.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.519
We veteran brokerage branches,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.639
we went door-to-door for clients back then.

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:07.959
We covered costs out of our own pockets.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:11.199
Every step was a hard-fought struggle.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:12.319
And now look,

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.519
they've created this Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.439
Our future livelihood

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:17.839
is going to be tough.

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:20.519
Tough.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.920
I actually have a plan.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.399
To make things tough for *them*.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.720
Jun Sheng,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.839
brew my good tea.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.639
On December 1st,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.360
let's also stick together for warmth.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.799
When the time comes,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.039
not a single buy or sell order

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.159
gets reported.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.440
Zero trades in the market.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.960
Let everyone see

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.759
that they don't have public support.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.200
That's a great idea!

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:54.519
We'll make sure they have zero trades on opening day.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.279
If the higher-ups find out we're

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:00.960
banding together to oppose them...

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.360
This isn't opposition.

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:04.279
It's a test from the market.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:05.840
Do you really want

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.720
to just stand by and watch

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.159
as we get kicked off the gaming table?

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:12.919
Here.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.159
Drink your tea.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.360
I'm thinking,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.679
first we spread some rumors outside

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.440
to keep the investors calm.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.159
Well, I know a few newspapers.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.519
I'll have them write some articles.

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:25.919
That's more like it.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.519
Unity is strength.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.240
You seem anxious.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960
I *am* anxious.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:38.639
Since the news about the Shenzhen Exchange opening

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:39.639
got out these past couple of days,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.240
the investors have been very anxious.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.039
They're afraid we'll press the wrong key and their money's gone.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.639
Right.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.000
So,

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.320
we need to find a way

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:49.519
to ease their concerns.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.519
How about we implement a

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:52.720
manual call auction,

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.120
combined with the computer.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.039
Hello?

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.559
Shenzhen Exchange.

00:09:58.919 --> 00:09:59.440
Understood.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:00.759
Good.

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:06.559
East Development, sell ten lots.

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:08.159
Unit price fifty.

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:15.440
East Development, buy ten lots. Trade executed.

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:16.480
Trade executed.

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:17.519
Put it on the board.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.159
Put it on the board.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.879
Do you understand?

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.519
Does everyone understand?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.639
Understood.

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:24.559
Do you have confidence?

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:25.399
Yes!

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.399
Starting tomorrow,

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.039
we all need to be like Liang Ying.

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:29.879
Loud voice, clear gestures.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.600
We must let everyone see

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:34.159
our trades.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.279
Today,

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:20.879
December 1st, 1990,

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:23.519
our Shenzhen Stock Exchange

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.039
officially opens for trading.

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:22.679
Quick, quick, quick!

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:23.759
Write this down first:

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:26.799
"Shenzhen Exchange opens with zero trades."

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.559
Not a single transaction.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.399
Isn't this a joke?

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.519
They should've said they couldn't reach an agreement.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.440
Who even knows if it's compliant?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.759
Do you think there'll be any trades today?

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:43.759
I think it'll be tough.

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:52.360
Hello? Shenzhen Exchange.

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:57.919
Okay.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.120
Shen An Da, sell.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.759
Twenty-five yuan, seventy-three fen.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.919
Shen An Da.

00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:11.600
Sell at twenty-five seventy-three.

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:17.759
Shen An Da.

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:19.279
Buy two lots.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:21.279
Good.

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:34.360
Hello?

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:36.000
What?

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:43.559
Didn't we all agree on zero trades?

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.120
Which traitor reported it?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.039
What are you doing here?

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:54.679
Get out.

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.039
The ones who should leave

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.879
are you.

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:08.519
Rest assured,

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:10.240
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange will ensure

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.240
everyone's rights and interests.

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:15.720
Thanks to you all,

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:18.279
for returning fairness and justice

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.879
to every investor and citizen.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.159
It's what we can do,

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:22.519
and what we should do.

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:24.159
Miss Liang is absolutely right.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.039
This is indeed

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:26.000
what we should do.

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:27.559
We must not betray

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.559
our own conscience.

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.879
You are the mastermind, Boss Wu.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200
Please cooperate with our investigation.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:42.960
Come with us.

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:49.919
Master.

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:51.600
Last time you said

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:54.080
you were looking for an answer seven years ago.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.159
Have you found it now?

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:01.159
This is Shenzhen.

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:04.039
This is the answer.

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:07.159
This young city

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:08.879
will never stop moving forward.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.440
Where are we going?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.000
For coffee.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.159
Where to?

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:44.360
Right here.

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:45.879
Shenzhen.
