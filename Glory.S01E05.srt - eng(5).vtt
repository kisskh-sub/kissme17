00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.710
[Glory]

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.950
[Episode 5]

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.759
Let's go.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.070
Since he's gone to Chongxi Hall,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.000
we should leave.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.759
Let's go.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.200
So it's that Yan family.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.840
Which Yan family?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.590
The Yan family was also

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.039
a prestigious clan in Linji.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.200
But for some reason,

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.479
they suddenly moved

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.070
to Shuzhong over a decade ago.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.759
I didn't expect

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.479
they would send someone here too.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.590
This is terrible.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.510
The Rong and Yan families

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.400
have been intermarrying for centuries.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.790
This one is a formidable rival.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.079
It seems you can't avoid

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.740
this kind of person anywhere.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.460
What bad luck.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.410
What's wrong?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.150
Even with the cover of medicinal
and sandalwood incense,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.079
that scent of blood still lingers.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.000
I caught a hint of it during our earlier

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.060
encounter as well.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.680
After all the effort
you went through to find it,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.810
you just smashed it?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
You really could let it go?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.380
I wanted to please her,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.190
but she cares about
that useless person instead.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.310
Afraid I might hurt him,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.590
she even had someone else
fight in his place.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.630
Not only did it break
the Rong family's rules,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.290
but it was also an insult to me!

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.800
No matter how passionately
you bare your heart,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.400
she will still

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.800
protect her dear cousin.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.329
What can you do about it?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800
If you care about the Rong family's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.910
tea plantations in the south

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.470
and their maritime tea routes,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.530
you might have to swallow your pride.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.520
No matter who she cares for in her heart,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.250
just focus on winning her over.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.310
If you truly love Miss Rong,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.750
then use patience and persistence,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.550
and you'll surely win her heart.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.800
So you're envious of

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.120
Mingzhou's deep-water harbor

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.579
and the endless wealth
from maritime trade.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.680
No wonder the He family
is willing to set aside grudges

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.240
and desperately wants their bloodline

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.560
to merge with the Rongs.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.750
You really are up to no good—

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.630
repeatedly provoking me to take action

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.230
so you can reap the benefits.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.510
You covet his cousin,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.640
while I want the Rong Family's tea.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.050
There's no difference between us.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.400
Compared to that pretentious

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400
Yan Bailou from the east courtyard,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.430
I'd rather deal with you.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.430
At least your wickedness
is straightforward.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.630
We need to think about

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.240
how to deal with

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.590
that hindrance.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.510
Spies.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.850
Miss Rong, lower your voice.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.970
Be careful of eavesdroppers.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.040
Forgive me, Miss Rong.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.440
I have confidential matters to report.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.170
Please allow me to come closer.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.500
Please consider this carefully.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.870
Mr. Wen's tea

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.930
was tampered with,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.240
He Xingming bribed others

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.610
for assistance in advance,

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.270
and they even knew the Rong family's

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.470
examination topics.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.390
Someone must have

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.780
leaked the martial contest details.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.220
[Xinfang Pavilion]

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.390
All you do is gamble and drink.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.630
I was only gone for a short while,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.120
and you couldn't even
guard the room properly!

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.120
What's the point of keeping you all?

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.750
You, come here. Perfect timing.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.940
I've lost several gold ingots,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.720
worth about 1,000 taels of silver.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.600
Those gold

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.180
and heavy lumps

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.440
would make a sound
if dropped on the floor!

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.430
Yet they've vanished from this room.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.680
Those who know think I'm a guest here;

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.630
those who don't

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.310
would think I've
fallen into a den of thieves!

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.270
That's right.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.480
Whoever took them, speak up now.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.010
Speak up.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.730
How do you explain this?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.650
Mr. Yang, please calm down.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.690
Since the items were lost
within the Rong Mansion,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.420
it's our duty to help find them.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.200
I'll give orders immediately

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.070
to search Xinfang Pavilion thoroughly.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.470
Searching isn't enough.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.680
The servants must be questioned too.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.310
Of course.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.070
We'll certainly give you an explanation.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.530
Go quickly.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.440
Yes.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.480
Once that thieving servant is caught,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.120
I'll tear his arms off.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.120
I want to see what's happening

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.850
in that room.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.120
Why are you stopping me?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.340
Gold ingots were stolen from his room.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.400
Did you steal them?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.950
No?

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.460
Then stay out of this mess.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.480
Get involved will only bring trouble.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.240
What you're saying

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.500
is quite interesting.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.000
What's that in your hand?

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.990
First comes the martial contest,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.070
then there will surely be a literary test.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.390
How are your studies, Young Master?

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.590
Can you pass the test?

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.670
These are the questions
my cousin leaked to me?

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.159
The Rong family's questions seem simple,

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.720
but they carry deeper meaning.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.310
Since ancient times, one's character
is revealed by how they handle wine.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.000
Those who misbehave when drunk

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.560
will be the first to be expelled.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.920
On the martial arts arena,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.870
they'll naturally test...

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.390
Naturally,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.800
they'll test whose
martial skills are superior.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.480
That Mr. Bai who lay on the ground

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.680
playing dead during the martial contest

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.880
still passed successfully, didn't he?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.040
Well...

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.770
Those who train diligently

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.230
and show courage can pass.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.560
Those who are shrewd

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.360
or favored by luck can also pass.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.220
Clearly, the Rong family has no fixed
rules for choosing a son-in-law.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.120
However, the Rong family
possesses vast wealth,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.130
and Lady Shanbao bears
tremendous responsibility.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.530
She still needs to choose
a worthy partner—

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.310
someone

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.200
who can win everyone's approval.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.880
The Rong family is in business.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.160
Poetry and essays
are just icing on the cake.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.960
Are you decent at calculations?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.710
The Rong family's horses
and ships are loaded with tea.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.840
How much do you know about tea affairs?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.909
Well, um...

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.909
I...

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.830
Better late than never, I suppose.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.890
What about that Yang Dingchen outside?

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.990
Are you really not going to deal with him?

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.120
Tonight I'll have extra candles

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120
sent to your room.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.040
You should focus on studying.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.110
Stop worrying about others.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.140
Steward Lu!

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.630
Something terrible has happened!

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.480
There's a poisonous snake

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480
in Mr. Wen's room!

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.170
Steward Lu!

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.750
Get him!

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.390
Get him!

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.360
Quick, bring the lantern over here!

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.870
Who...

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.420
Who are you people?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.480
Don't waste words with him.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.890
Let's go to the hall to talk.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:43.420
Let's go.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:53.780
Wanwan.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.450
Beautiful.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.750
Mrs. Yan, look.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.000
Sister made this for me.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.720
Isn't it pretty?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.670
Yes.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.700
It looks lovely on you, My Lady.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.890
Lady Shanbao,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.360
at Xinfang Pavilion...

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.540
Wanwan's flower crown

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.160
needs a few more pink camellias.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.360
I'll go pick some from the garden for you.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.560
Be good and wait here.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200
Hurry back then.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.150
I'll be waiting.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.700
There are many visitors
in the house lately.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.760
Don't take Wanwan wandering around
unless necessary.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.040
Yes.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.790
Mrs. Yan.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.430
Mrs. Yan,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.270
I want this yellow one.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.440
Alright.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.850
I heard shouting outside at night,

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.910
saying that there was

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.900
a poisonous snake in Mr. Wen's room.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.090
I hurried to check,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.690
but someone ambushed me halfway.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.320
I'm just as confused.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.120
I don't know which

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.510
house rule I've violated

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.310
to be seized without any reason.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.960
What happened tonight

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.270
is witnessed by
all the young masters here.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.440
How dare you

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.300
tell such lies?

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.590
That's right.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.210
There was indeed a snake,

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.410
but it was in

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.670
Mr. Yang's room.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.140
Someone did

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.910
plant a snake in Mr. Yang's room.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.840
Everyone saw it.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:44.330
This is bad.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.320
Steward Cheng,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.350
I led people to search

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.810
and found this in his room.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.170
Well, well!

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.920
I...

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.730
So it was you who stole them,

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.210
making the rest of us suspects!

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.140
How vicious an inside thief can be!

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.560
You...

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.830
I see now.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.840
It must have been him
who stole my valuables.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.170
After I made such a fuss this afternoon,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.250
he feared someone would
search and find them,

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.710
so he planted
a green bamboo viper in my room.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.240
Fortunately, my servant
was alert at night

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.320
and so he failed.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.320
Truly, heaven protects the virtuous!

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.720
If Mr. Yang really suffered

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.440
from poison because of five gold ingots,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.270
then the Rong family

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.400
would be guilty of harboring thieves.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.960
It's pitiful that such a young child

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.470
had to take the calamity for his master.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.480
Bear with it.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.500
My little Jifa.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.150
Fusheng,

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.000
we have both witnesses
and evidence right here.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.530
Do you have anything to say?

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.770
Steward Cheng,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.600
I was well aware that the mansion
was searching for stolen goods.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.670
If I had taken the gold ingots,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.480
I would've buried them
in a secluded place

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.360
and retrieved them
after things had calmed down.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.390
Why would I openly hide them in my room?

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.080
Moreover,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.840
the entire garden is full of tea trees.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.240
Spring thunder could
startle snakes to slither about.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.720
It's possible they might
have disturbed the guests.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.480
Why insist

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.390
that I did it?

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.840
Besides,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.320
he could catch the slithering snake,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.150
yet somehow

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.440
he let the culprit
who planted the snake escape.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.970
Isn't that rather strange?

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.840
With both stolen goods and witnesses,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.670
how dare a mere servant like you argue!

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.270
Everyone,

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.550
if this happened in my household,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.750
he'd be beaten to death on the spot!

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.390
Exactly!

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.440
Just stealing the gold would be one thing,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.120
but using snakes
to harm people is unforgivable.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.670
This servant stole from his own household.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.080
He should be flogged 100 times!

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.000
According to the law of theft,
he should be sentenced to be hanged!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.360
Mr. He speaks rightly.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.550
Drag him away and beat him to death!

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.270
Which of his points is unreasonable

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:39.960
that he must be punished?

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.910
Even the County Office

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.390
allows the accused to plead their case.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:42.910
You...

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.550
You're more tyrannical
than the county magistrate!

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.390
You're actually trying

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.150
to take someone's life so casually.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.910
All of you here are educated men.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.170
Did the sages teach you

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.550
to be arrogant with your talents

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.150
and treat human lives so lightly?

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.910
All... all your

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.440
learning has gone to waste!

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.480
What are you saying?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.510
You're so eager

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.630
to defend a thief.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.720
I wonder

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.790
are you the one who told him
to plant the snake?

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.870
-I...
-Yes, it was him!

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.080
Seeing he couldn't measure up to others,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.200
he incited his servant to harm people.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.360
We haven't even started on you yet.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.790
Reckless behavior!
You're in this together!

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.440
We should tie you up and charge you both!

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.150
That's right! Exactly!

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.790
Am I wrong?

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.840
Have you forgotten what you just said?

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.440
Let go!

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.340
Steward Cheng,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.600
I am lowly and insignificant,
not worth mentioning.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.200
But they have

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.000
treated Lady Shanbao's cousin

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.750
like a thief.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.750
All this talk of thieves' dens,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.120
stealing from one's own household...

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.240
Which family are they insulting?

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.960
Who exactly are they disrespecting?

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.530
Insulting me alone is one thing,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.390
but they've also

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.510
insulted my masters as well.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.190
How is this a marriage proposal visit?

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.850
It's clearly troublemaking!

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.860
Steward Cheng,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.300
things have gotten this far.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.500
Are you just going to stand by and watch?

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.230
Gentlemen, mind your words.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.580
If you speak inappropriately again,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.850
don't blame the Rong family
for disrespecting guests.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.150
Nonsense!

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:58.720
Are you trying

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.910
to shift the blame?

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:00.960
We're scolding

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.150
only you, this servant.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.440
Guards! Take him away immediately!

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.440
Tear out his filthy tongue!

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.960
Give him 100 lashes before questioning!

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.480
Wait.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.200
Mr. Yang,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.600
if not for his sake, then for mine.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.120
This man is from Qilan Garden.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.000
I cannot decide his fate.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.130
This is not allowed.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.200
He used poison to harm others,
which is a heinous crime.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.390
Consider it as doing your lady a favor,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.480
punishing evil.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.870
We'll handle it ourselves

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.470
and won't trouble you at all.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.380
But this...

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.740
Do it now!

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.720
Arrest him!

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.410
Let's see who dares!

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.360
-Let go!
-Seize him!

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.160
Drag him away!

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.100
Let's see where you can go!

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.270
-Release me!
-Don't try to escape!

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:38.990
You too!

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:40.950
How dare you!

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.390
Let go!

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.670
Guards!

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:50.550
-Yes.
-Mr. Wen!

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.480
If you can't subdue him,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.510
each of you will take

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.770
20 lashes in his place.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:54.690
Let go.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.080
Go!

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.240
Mr. Wen!

00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.870
Let me go!

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:03.960
Mr. Wen!

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.069
Stop!

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.109
Serves you right!

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:34.930
Lady Shanbao is here.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.810
Won't you stop now?

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.990
Lady Shanbao, this is...

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.990
Are you all here as guests

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.640
or to cause trouble?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.590
Fighting like this, losing all dignity—

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.920
where are your manners?

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.680
Get up.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.550
Mr. Wen.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.000
Are you alright?

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.870
Thank you.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.090
Where's the doctor?

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.720
Coming, coming!

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.350
Coming.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.160
Shanbao, don't worry about me.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.270
I'm fine.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.350
I just took a few sneaky punches.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.570
Please don't worry.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.240
D-Doctor,

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.540
go check on him.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.720
I'm fine. I'm fine, Shanbao.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.110
Young man, where are you hurt?

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.040
I'm fine too.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.530
Go get medicine for Mr. Wen.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.480
Go.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.440
Lady Shanbao,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.310
that scoundrel stole my gold,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.510
yet your cousin blatantly shielded him,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.970
stirring public outrage.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.500
I hope you'll handle this fairly,

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.430
without bias,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.450
to quiet the public outcry.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.720
We spoke out against injustice.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.240
We tried to reason with him,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.370
but he insisted on helping that thief.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.400
We are outsiders here.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.350
Please make a fair judgment, Lady Shanbao.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.880
I've always trusted those I employ

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.680
and not employ those I distrust.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.730
By accusing him of theft today,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.210
you're questioning my judgment,

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.160
suggesting I can't tell
loyalty from treachery,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.890
and that I've harbored a thief?

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.080
As we live in this world,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.240
our words can cut like an axe.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.960
Speak with malice

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.040
and you'll inevitably
face the retribution.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.240
Fusheng,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.750
Public clamor can melt metals;
Slander can destroy one's reputation.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.550
If you can prove your innocence,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.420
then let everyone know

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.540
that Lady Shanbao hasn't
trusted the wrong person.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.920
I owe Miss Rong my life,

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.310
and I'm willing to repay her kindness
with my life.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.200
My own life and honor are trivial matters,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.070
but I cannot allow Miss Rong

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.600
to be wronged because of me.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.400
Since the stolen goods
were found in my room,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.260
I humbly request everyone to come

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.010
and take a look inside my room.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.640
Lady Shanbao,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640
it was me and Jingzhong who

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.000
discovered the stolen goods

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.800
tied with a red string
hanging under the bed board.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.660
Right here.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.920
W-Why… Why is the cinnabar

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.580
scattered all over the floor?

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.480
Cinnabar? What cinnabar?

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.200
Where did this cinnabar come from?

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.510
Please forgive me, My Lady.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.590
At noon he reported that

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.440
Mr. Wen wasn't sleeping well at night

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:34.920
and asked for some

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.830
cinnabar, coptis, and roasted licorice,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.310
requesting me to make a sachet

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.960
to help Mr. Wen calm his mind.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.510
I thought it was too much trouble,

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.910
so I told him to put it
in the pillow instead,

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.310
then sent him away.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.160
It's my fault for not being careful.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.620
I didn't realize
it had spilled everywhere.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.110
Right!

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.240
This is providence.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.830
Someone waited until I left

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.310
to plant stolen goods in my room.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.480
We only need to check the shoe soles

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.080
to know who the real thief is.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.530
-That makes sense.
-He's right.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.130
One check and it'll be clear.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.370
Don't be afraid.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.840
Those who searched should be innocent.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.240
But those who deliberately framed others

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.700
won't escape punishment.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.840
Take off his shoes.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.960
There's cinnabar.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.730
-It's him.
-It was actually him.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.940
Lady Shanbao!

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.920
I've been wronged!

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.380
I know nothing about this!

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.640
So you're the greedy thief

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.970
who has been fooling all of us.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.750
I knew someone as shifty-eyed as you

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.700
couldn't be trusted.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.920
You stole my belongings

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.600
and even dared to frame someone else!

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.510
I can't believe there's

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.680
such a shameless

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.960
and ungrateful thief in this world!

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.920
Speak! Why did you frame him?

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.670
Is this truly what happened?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.000
I was in charge of
the food in this pavilion,

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.580
with a monthly wage of one tael,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.520
plus additional tips
from the noble guests.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.590
But all of it was taken by that

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.590
backdoor dealer.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.920
I wish I could tear him to pieces!

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.350
It was all a misunderstanding.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.640
My rush to catch the thief

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.770
ended up wronging an innocent person.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.230
Wronging a servant or two is no big deal.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.340
However, Mr. Yang,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.640
you shouldn't have believed others' gossip

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.850
and falsely accused Lady Shanbao
of poor judgment and harboring thieves.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.310
If this spreads tomorrow,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.070
it will damage
the Rong family's reputation.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.600
If Old Madam Rong finds out,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
she wouldn't approve of those

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.860
troublemakers

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.160
and dishonorable men

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.160
becoming her granddaughter's husband.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.490
Should her anger flare,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.720
may I ask, how could

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.680
any of you rest easy?

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.160
Please calm down, Lady Shanbao.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.960
We were too gullible.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.670
It's just a trivial matter.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.270
We wouldn't dare
disturb Old Madam Rong.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.920
Please forgive our rashness.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.270
We won't disturb you any further.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.670
We'll take our leave now.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.640
Yes.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.010
We'll leave right away.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.510
Be my guest.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.160
Let's go. Let's go.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:25.790
Hurry up.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.310
What is it?

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.290
Mr. Yang, you still have grievances?

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.300
It seems the Rong family
hasn't been hospitable enough,

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.500
and has mistreated our esteemed guest.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.990
Why don't you come with me
to see my grandmother

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.120
and let her be the judge of this matter?

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.340
Lady Shanbao, never mind.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.360
I'm simply too kindhearted and gullible,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.670
easily influenced
and manipulated by others.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.150
I've rashly offended you,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.030
and should apologize profusely.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.000
But my poor Jifa

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.640
is suffering terribly from snake venom.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.070
I'm extremely worried

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.640
and want to hurry back to check on him.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.370
I'll come tomorrow
to properly apologize to you.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.830
Thank you, Lady Shanbao,
for clearing my name.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.590
Mr. Yan,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.330
thank you for speaking up for justice.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.070
You're becoming increasingly useless,

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.730
can't even handle
such a small matter properly.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.380
I handled this poorly

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.330
which led to such a mess.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.920
I know I've made a serious mistake.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.480
I'll accept whatever
punishment you see fit.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.740
Go find the steward for your punishment.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.690
Yes.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.480
Lady Shanbao,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.000
besides those who planted evidence,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.200
the servants who searched

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200
this room tonight

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.550
should also be detained

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.640
and interrogated strictly.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.100
Also, those responsible for night patrols—

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.000
how exactly was the snake let in?

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.960
They should all be questioned too.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.290
Please forgive me, Lady Shanbao!

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.730
I'm innocent!

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.820
Innocent or not,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.440
we'll find out after interrogation.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.000
Guards!

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.480
Move! Get up!

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.200
Lady Shanbao, please save us!

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.860
We had nothing to do with this!

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.520
Go!

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:37.980
Lady Shanbao!

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.270
Look at that glare—

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.180
as if I were some scheming

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.160
consort whispering
poison into the emperor's ear.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.960
You still have the mood to joke?

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.730
After all this commotion,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.200
how is your old wound?

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.550
I...

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.440
Quickly, get Mr. Zhao.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:05.720
Yes.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.650
No need for that.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.090
I can treat this wound.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.230
I didn't expect Mr. Yan

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.830
would know medicine as well.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.910
The mountains are full of herbs.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.440
I've read a few medical books
in my spare time.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.180
I can handle minor ailments.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.500
But your injury is too severe.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.530
You need to rest properly for half a year.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.920
If the wound reopens,

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.750
not even Hua Tuo himself could save you.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.570
Well, I just

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.800
have a restless nature
and can't stand being idle.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.260
Just give me some
more hemostatic medicine.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.680
External wounds are easy to treat;
internal organs are not.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.080
Your regular medication

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.030
needs to add sour jujube seeds

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.400
and albizzia bark.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.730
Has my condition changed?

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.100
When the five senses are clear,
gold easily transforms.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.590
When the three minds are unsettled,
water hardly dissipates.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.640
Your inner fire is too strong,
and your senses are restless.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.230
You must calm your mind and worry less.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.490
You speak like a Buddhist,

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.200
so why do you still come
to propose marriage?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.400
If you truly have no desires,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.130
why would you still want a wife?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.170
When others insult me and bully me,

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.970
you still tell me to stay calm.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.280
If a villain were to spit on you,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.170
could you really endure it?

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.200
My master said my earthly
ties aren't yet severed,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:32.960
so I came.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.360
This is called following fate.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.750
When someone spits on my face,

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.040
just let it dry by itself.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.130
It saves me effort

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.790
and spares others trouble.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.550
This is called accepting one's lot.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.200
Step away from right and wrong conflicts,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.130
and you'll find true peace of mind.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.000
Stop.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.920
You truly are magnanimous.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:50.950
As for me,

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.930
I'm just a narrow-minded mortal.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.800
I tally every slight
and repay every grudge.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.400
You'd better

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.530
not waste your words

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.080
trying to persuade me.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.990
How is he?

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.720
He's fine.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.870
Lady Shanbao, come with me for a moment.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.480
What's up?

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.830
If you have insomnia
or palpitations again,

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.090
just massage the Baihui acupoint,

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.910
the Shuaigu acupoint above the ear tip,

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:41.840
and the temples.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.080
They all help calm the mind
and soothe the spirit.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.370
In the past,

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.640
I was only

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.440
close to deer in the wilderness.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.430
I'm not used to dealing with people.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.630
I acted impulsively.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.180
However,

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.100
peace of mind is essential for good sleep.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.070
These men

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.120
have thrown the Rong family into chaos

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.840
and it's truly disgusting.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.190
Since ancient times, the problem
has never been scarcity, but inequality.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.720
Your excessive favoritism
toward one person

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.140
not only harms him

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.000
but also provokes everyone's anger.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.380
You blame me for being biased?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.880
Rong Shanbao,

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.180
you are indeed biased.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.160
Childhood sweethearts
may share deep feelings,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.410
but latecomers may not
necessarily have shallow connections.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.670
You should treat me...

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.600
and others

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.960
more fairly.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.150
Lady Shanbao, Steward Zhang is here.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.040
The person you asked about

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.810
was originally a servant in the household

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.940
of Luo Zhan, the Governor of Yingtian.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.020
From the age of five,

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.610
he accompanied
the eldest grandson of the Luo family,

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.240
Luo Chuance, as his study companion.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.890
But the absurdity

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.880
of it all is that

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.480
Young Master Luo
had no interest in studying,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.920
yet that little page boy
had exceptional talent

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.180
and remarkable intelligence.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.530
He earned Luo Zhan's
high regard and appreciation,

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.810
who graciously granted him
a certificate of freedom.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.610
Indeed, at fourteen,

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.510
he topped the provincial examination.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.310
The countryside was astounded.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.400
Sadly, he couldn't take
the metropolitan examination.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.580
According to local rumors,

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.080
Young Master Luo
resented his grandfather's favoritism,

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.720
often beating and scolding

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.740
the page boy as a child.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.310
After Luo Zhan passed away,

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.120
the family held a grand funeral.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.010
He deliberately played tricks on

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.680
Mr. Lu who came to pay respects,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.410
accidentally causing a death.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:56.770
Father! Wake up!

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.270
Father, wake up!

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.230
Father!

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.840
Father, wake up.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.670
Father.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.880
Father!

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.240
Father.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.550
What happened then?

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.000
After the three-year
mourning period ended,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.370
he successfully passed

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.410
the metropolitan, provincial
and palace examinations,

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.940
achieved the highest rank,

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.480
and was appointed to the Imperial Academy.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.720
As for Luo Chuance,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.200
he spent his days
bullying men and harassing women,

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200
committing all kinds of evil deeds.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.000
The people despised him deeply.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.720
Then one day,
he fell into the water while drunk.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.060
Don't worry.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.890
I won't kill you.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.210
The Luo family's inheritance

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.470
has been completely gambled away by you.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.470
For the rest of your life,

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.420
you can suffer in hell.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.020
Lord Lu put aside past grievances

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.430
and rescued that villain from the water.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.670
Later, when the Luo family fell into ruin,

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.800
it was also Lord Lu

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.190
who remembered
Governor Luo's past kindness

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.990
and provided support and care.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.240
When locals talk about this,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.290
who doesn't praise his generosity

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.210
and how he returned good for evil?

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.070
Sadly, heaven envied his talent.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.830
Earlier this year, he hurried
back to the capital from Linji.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.400
When his boat reached the middle
of the river, a sudden wave struck.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.130
The boat was destroyed,
and all aboard perished.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.440
Allperished?

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.220
He's dead?

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.290
Minister Xu himself
presided over the funeral

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.820
and personally wrote
the memorial couplets.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:48.500
I see.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.230
You may go now.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.270
Yes.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.590
No wonder not a single person

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.790
came looking for him.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.210
He went from a living person
to a dead one.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.350
Lu Jianglai,

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.880
what kind of enmity
have you actually incurred?

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.800
If I send you back now,

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.440
it would undoubtedly

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.639
lead you to a dead end.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.920
Just stay here

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.190
at the Rong Mansion.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:24.710
You have no idea

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.620
how lively it was last night.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.630
Unfortunately, I was in deep sleep

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.110
and didn't witness it myself.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.400
Poor Cheng Guanyu

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.120
who has always been

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.750
so faithful to Lady Shanbao.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.170
Now he's been dragged down by them.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.940
I heard Ms. Yan will personally
carry out the punishment.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.840
That's not right.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.150
What's wrong with that?

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.080
The Yang family is of noble lineage

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.489
and often does business with our family.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:51.510
A mere servant

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.800
who offended Mr. Yang

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.070
should just be dealt with quietly.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.230
For what reason

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.010
must they make such a big fuss about it?

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.720
Of course it's for Cousin Wen.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.590
Could it be

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.920
for that lowly servant?

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.400
Yunyin, did you get a clear look

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.840
at that person's look?

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.030
Cuiwei,

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.150
keep an eye on that Fusheng.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.280
Yes.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.840
Don't think I don't know

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.280
what you're thinking.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.500
You deliberately stood by,

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.350
letting those people
reveal their ugly sides,

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:33.920
all to make Lady Shanbao
despise them even more!

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.920
Isn't that right?

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.400
They're nothing but

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.600
bloodsucking flies drawn by the scent.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.410
They covet the Rong family's
tea mountains and wealth.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.130
All I did

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.050
is simply letting Lady Shanbao

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.360
see their true faces.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:52.190
Who do you think you are

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.720
to meddle in their affairs?

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.980
You must always remember

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.640
you're just a beggar
taken in by the Rong family.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.610
Lady Shanbao provides
for your basic needs,

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.380
the Rong family has educated you,

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.580
so you should repay them with your life.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.000
Don't interfere with
your masters' affairs.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.120
And don't you dare

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.190
have even the slightest

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.790
filthy thought in your mind!

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.530
I won't forget.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.200
I wouldn't dare forget in this lifetime.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.150
I raised you myself,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.230
so I must warn you.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.840
You grew up with her when you were young.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.230
You were like her brother

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.630
and her close companion.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.960
But Lady Shanbao is the master
and you are the servant.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.620
Master and servant
are ultimately different.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.480
This boundary cannot be crossed.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.840
In the future,

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.980
she will be matched
with a noble young master.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.040
How could you possibly aspire to her?

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.780
If you continue to harbor
inappropriate thoughts,

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.140
you'll end up with no place
for your body to rest.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.140
Think carefully.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.300
Steward Cheng!

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.000
I merely

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.530
drove away a swarm of flies.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.670
What did I do wrong?

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.420
It's all your terrible idea.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:19.800
That vicious hound wouldn't die,

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.660
and it ended up biting us instead.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.600
Why do you keep following me?

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.320
Aren't we here
to apologize to Lady Shanbao?

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.320
Mr. Yang, have you made up your mind?

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:35.250
Lady Shanbao?

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.600
Lady Shanbao.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.930
The mountain land that you've chosen

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.590
can be cleared within a month.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.070
Those 3,000 tea plants

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.930
will be transplanted there soon.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.550
Though the land by the water
on the east side of the mountain

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.550
is occupied by mountain villagers,

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.430
in my humble opinion,

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.920
we can hire the men from the mountains

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.920
to clear the land

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.440
and send some skilled workers

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.760
from our tea plantations

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.190
to teach the women
how to pick and process tea leaves.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.590
We must not delay
the picking of the first spring tea.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.510
Discuss it with Yi
and proceed accordingly.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.510
Lady Shanbao, please rest assured.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.200
Lady Shanbao.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.200
Lady Shanbao!

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.230
Lady Shanbao, could it be that

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.760
you're still angry with me?

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.000
Why were all

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.660
the gifts I sent returned?

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.360
Yesterday was a misunderstanding.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.510
I upset you,

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.240
and I feel deeply uneasy.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.200
If you haven't forgiven me,

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.030
I can neither eat nor sleep...

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.480
Mr. Yang, you worry too much.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.800
It's been raining for the past few days,

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.030
but today the sky has cleared up.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.890
And there's a north wind blowing.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.070
The tea plantation must be busy

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.760
harvesting the first spring tea.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.670
I've heard Lady Shanbao

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.230
handles everything personally.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.630
You must be heading
to the tea mountain now.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.550
Lady Shanbao, please.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.920
Truly worthy of being
the heir to Huqiu Tea,

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.510
explaining everything about

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:59.190
the tea plantation so thoroughly.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.630
Lady Shanbao is busy
with important matters.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.590
You and I should leave now.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:02.440
Let's go.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.360
What? Reluctant to move?

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.480
I heard the Rong family has

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.080
a tea tree over 300 years old.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:09.360
They've also sent people everywhere

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.000
to collect precious tea varieties.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.360
In order to transplant

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.070
a thousand-year-old
wild tea trees from Yunnan,

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.960
they actually relocated

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.800
an entire village,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.670
just to secure

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.590
the best tea cultivators in the world.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:20.590
Such determination—

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.450
your He family could never match.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.000
You've been following me

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.150
around the tea plantation

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.280
since early morning.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.800
Don't tell me you're after the tea.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.200
You...

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.670
Lady Shanbao.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.000
Lady Shanbao has invited you

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.190
to tour the tea mountain today.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.790
Please go back and get ready.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280
This tea mountain

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.630
has over 80 tea plantations,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:39.560
large and small,

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.920
with over 1,000 tea workers.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.280
The tea plantations
provide food and lodging.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.440
The workers' children

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.880
can study at
the Rong family's private school.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.590
In the prefectures and counties
near Linji alone,

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.590
there are 6 more such tea mountains.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.780
Now is the spring harvest season.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.150
Although it's said in the trade

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.590
that picking tea
before Qingming Festival is too early,

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.880
and after the Beginning of Summer
is too late,

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.190
with the best time
being around Grain Rain.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.760
But rarity brings value.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.760
Tea leaves picked before Qingming Festival

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.800
are tender, fresh, and sweet,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.330
and more favored by people.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.280
Just one jin of tea bud heads

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.280
requires seven or eight people

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.740
picking for an entire day.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.630
And it must be done

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.630
during these few days
when the leaves are most tender.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.810
So many young masters here.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.030
Gentlemen, please wait a moment.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.090
I'll go ahead and make preparations.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.280
Wasn't Lady Shanbao supposed to be here?

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.670
Why hasn't she shown up yet?

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:53.760
It's so muddy here.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.920
With such a grand estate,
how could the Rong family

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.880
let their precious daughter

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.840
suffer like this?

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.510
Even a country gentry's daughter

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.550
keeps her feet clean.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.190
Let's stop and rest for a while.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.150
My new robe.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.100
Take a rest.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:10.110
Mr. Wen,

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.160
that night Mr. He invited me for drinks.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.370
I had a few too many and fell asleep.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.960
It almost caused a big mistake.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.230
If I had been there then,

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.000
you wouldn't have been left helpless.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.440
I blame myself for being so gullible.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.550
One can be a thief for 1,000 days,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.070
but who can guard
against thieves for 1,000 days?

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.380
My good brother, you're pure-hearted,

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.150
certainly no match for others' schemes.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.950
Don't mind it.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.420
Who was so cruel?

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.810
Let me see your injury.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.340
It's fine. Already healed.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:35.910
Young Master,

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.280
look at that tea-picking girl.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.860
She's teaching how to pick tender leaves.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.840
This is the Rong family's

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.360
foundation of livelihood.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.490
Since we're here at the tea plantation,

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.550
why not learn about tea cultivation?

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:46.880
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.410
Why should I listen to that?

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:50.690
Do you expect me to compete with the girls

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.490
in dexterity?

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.840
Exactly.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.840
And no beautiful ladies in sight either.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.040
What a waste of a trip.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.880
Let's go find Steward Cheng.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:58.630
Okay.

00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:59.480
Let's go.

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:01.550
Young Master,

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:03.700
stop wandering around.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.650
Why not listen for a while?

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.140
Since we're here,
we might as well settle in.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.880
I noticed the tea workers

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.870
are extremely respectful
to that tea-picking girl.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.110
I suspect her position
in the tea plantation

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:15.770
is unusual.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.150
Be patient.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:19.150
Let's go.
