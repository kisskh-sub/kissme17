WEBVTT

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.200
The path ahead is too narrow for the carriage.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.439
You'll all have to follow me into the city on foot.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.280
Second Master.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.239
What's the matter with that forest?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.480
Why does everyone's expression change

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:55.719
the moment we mention it?

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:00.159
I've been away on a long trip.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:00.840
I've only just returned.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.480
I'm not entirely clear on the specifics.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.319
Just remember this, everyone:

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.239
You must never enter that forest.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.439
Young Master Pan.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.759
Second Master Luo has been away from Tianyin City for so long.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.439
It's good to have you back at last.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.400
Young Master, watch out!

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.560
Are you alright?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm fine.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.360
What's wrong?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.479
Is Fourth Sister okay?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.120
My foot seems to be sprained.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.280
Let's go sit down up ahead.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:48.360
Let's go.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.800
Take it slow.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.080
Does it still hurt?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.120
I was just up in the tree picking medicinal fruit

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.159
when I accidentally fell.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:05.919
Thank you, miss, for coming to my aid.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.560
How do you know Second Master Luo?

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:12.719
We met him outside the city.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.319
He saw we were heading to Tianyin City

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.360
and kindly offered to guide us.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.599
You may have injured the tendons or bones.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.800
It so happens I run a clinic in the city.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.319
Why don't you come with me, miss?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.560
I'll give you a proper examination.

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:27.719
Thank you, Young Master Pan.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.360
Young Master Pan.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.719
I'm in a hurry to get home.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.319
I'll trouble you to take them the rest of the way.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.599
Alright.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.520
Alright.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:38.599
Thank you, Second Master.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.919
This is the place.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.319
Let her sit down first.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.759
Alright.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.599
Young Master.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.639
Put the medicinal herbs away.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.479
Young Master Pan is out searching for herbs again.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.280
Young Master Pan gathers herbs and treats patients.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.240
He really should take better care of his health.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.280
Has your condition improved recently?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.040
Much better.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.240
Good. I'll go attend to other matters then.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:28.839
Apply some ointment.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.279
Is there a female physician?

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.000
It's just treating a wound. It's fine.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.639
A Lan, you do it.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.720
Young Master Pan is a physician.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.000
He's the professional.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.600
Naturally, he should apply the medicine.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.920
I...

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.879
Consider this a favor I owe you.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.959
Hurry up.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.519
Fine.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.759
Then I'll kindly help you this once.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:09.319
Apply the ointment to the ankle.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.360
Rub it in thoroughly.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.639
Does it hurt, Fourth Sister?

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.839
Done.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:34.240
Are you okay?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.879
Fortunately, no tendons or bones were injured.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:39.519
Young Master Pan.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.000
I'd like to ask you something.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.959
What happened in the forest outside the city?

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:48.399
Why have you come to Tianyin City?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.399
Just for sightseeing.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.360
If it's just sightseeing,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.240
then there's no need to ask further.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.160
Leave sooner rather than later.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.319
Young Master Pan, you should still tell us

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.000
what exactly happened in that forest.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.639
We're extremely curious.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.480
To explain in detail...

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.600
It's also my fault.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.360
The forest outside the city

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.000
is perpetually shrouded in miasma.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.879
Two months ago, I developed an Antidote Pill.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.399
After taking it, the common folk

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.480
could enter the forest

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.759
to search for some precious medicinal herbs.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:16.040
It was originally a good thing.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.360
Who would have thought...

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.040
It's right up ahead.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.120
Be careful.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.879
There's a ghost!

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.079
A ghost! There's a ghost!

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.360
A ghost!

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.920
Help!

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.120
Help!

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.519
There's a ghost!

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.680
What happened to those two men later?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.240
Only one escaped.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.560
The other remains missing to this day.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:51.959
His body hasn't been found either.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.360
The one who escaped

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.240
kept saying there was a ghost in the Miasma Forest.

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.720
A few days later, he suddenly vanished.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.240
Afterwards, others also

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.879
entered the Miasma Forest one after another.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.600
But no one ever came out again.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:06.199
Up to today,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.800
six people have vanished without a trace.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.720
No bodies have been found.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:10.639
Did the authorities send anyone to investigate?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.399
They did send several groups.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.720
But all returned empty-handed.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.519
Now, the Miasma Forest

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.000
has become a taboo in Tianyin City.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.480
The people in the city

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.120
say a female ghost haunts the forest.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:23.120
So no one dares to go near it anymore.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.519
I think someone is playing tricks.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.920
Miss.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.720
What size shoes do you wear?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.439
I'll have someone buy you a comfortable pair.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:36.519
Once your injury heals...

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.160
I know what size A Zi wears.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:38.959
I'll go buy them.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:42.399
Then, miss, why not stay at the Benevolent Peace Hall

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:43.079
for a couple of days?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.319
We have some guest rooms

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.040
specifically for patients from out of town.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.319
You're too kind, sir.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.399
We'll stay at an inn.

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:52.120
Today, I fell from a tree.

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:53.720
I was fortunate you came to my rescue.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.839
Even small birds know to repay a kindness.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.000
I, Pan, should

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.439
look after you properly.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.600
Young Master Pan.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800
Just call me A Zi.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:02.680
Alright, Miss A Zi.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.839
Then I'll have someone prepare medicine for you first.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:12.439
Help those guests

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:13.279
arrange some rooms.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:13.720
Yes, sir.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.600
I think that Miasma Forest

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.920
definitely has something strange going on.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:21.480
Look over there.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:29.639
The woman in this painting

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.759
Which deity or bodhisattva is she?

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:32.080
Why don't I recognize her?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.039
Look at the words at the bottom of the portrait.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.000
My Wife, Lin Siqing

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.399
My wife...

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.559
Whose wife?

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:46.120
What do you think?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.440
Take two more doses according to the previous prescription.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.120
Alright.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:52.639
Shopkeeper, the same prescription as before, please.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.320
Young Master Pan has a gentle temperament.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.720
And he's a doctor who heals the sick and wounded.

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.840
He's truly worth befriending.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200
But I don't understand.

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:04.720
Why do all these townsfolk

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.679
show such reverence

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.879
towards his wife's portrait?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.679
That's because

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:12.080
Miss Lin is the benefactor of our Tianyin City!

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.720
Yes.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.559
If it weren't for Young Master Pan and Miss Lin,

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:16.120
Tianyin City would have been gone long ago.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.679
How so?

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.360
Sir, you may not know this.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.960
The water sources in Tianyin City are strange.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.600
The people who drank this water

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:23.720
became weak and sickly,

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:24.919
rarely living past forty.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:28.039
Later, Young Master Pan and Miss Lin arrived.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.600
They had us drink

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.799
their specially prepared bitter tea daily.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.120
Only then could the people of Tianyin City

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.440
escape their days of illness and suffering.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.399
Such compassion from a healer.

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:37.440
Young Master Pan,

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.720
our group has discussed it.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.320
We plan to stay here a few more days

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.480
to allow A Zi to recuperate.

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:43.440
What do you think?

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.000
That's fine.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.440
It's a pity Miss Lin has already passed away.

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.200
Yes.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.120
Such a shame.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.159
Young Master Pan's wife died?

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:55.639
Yes.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.639
She caught a slight chill.

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:02.320
It's nothing serious.

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:03.759
I'll have someone fetch some medicine.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.440
Thank you for the trouble, Young Master Pan.

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:13.480
Miss A Lan,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.519
your and Miss A Zi's room is over there.

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:23.360
Just tell me where the room is.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.639
I'll go there myself in a moment.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.279
It's the one at the end of the corridor.

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:28.320
The other two gentlemen's room is next door.

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:29.480
Thank you.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.639
You can go attend to your business then.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:31.639
Very well, Miss A Lan.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.279
So, who's the poor soul we need to save this time?

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:52.240
This time, we need to save a

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.200
very precious life.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.360
All living beings are equal.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.159
Every life is precious.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.120
Just tell me.

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:00.679
Who exactly needs saving?

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:03.039
Well, the one we need to save this time

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:04.519
is actually a plant.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.519
It's called the Celestial Frostbloom.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:10.120
A plant?

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:12.000
A... herb?

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:14.519
Let me correct that.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:18.399
The Celestial Frostbloom is a flower, not an herb.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.519
Then why isn't it just called the Celestial Frost Flower?

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.759
Look, asking me to save a little black pig was one thing,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.639
but now you're having me save a flower?

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:33.320
I naturally have my reasons.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.720
Don't tell me saving this flower

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:38.759
is also related to saving a person?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.399
When the time is right,

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.080
you'll know naturally.

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.080
Stop being cryptic.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.120
Tell me.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.399
How does the flower die?

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:50.720
In a few days,

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.240
it dies within Tianyin City's Miasma Forest.

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:56.159
The Miasma Forest?

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:58.200
That haunted Miasma Forest?

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.159
What does the flower look like?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.639
You drew for so long

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.279
and came up with *this* thing?

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.240
I'm an abstract artist.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840
It's certainly abstract.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.759
So abstract I feel like slapping you.

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:27.720
Great art

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.639
is often misunderstood.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:32.600
I don't blame you.

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:35.200
Oh, right.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.159
The Celestial Frostbloom is white.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:39.480
Don't mistake it for something else.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.480
Bye-bye.

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:47.799
Darn it.

00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:56.440
This way, please.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.559
Your foot is still injured.

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:06.519
Rest for a while first.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.879
Young Master Pan is quite attentive to Royal Sister.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:20.639
At this time of year,

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:21.799
where did you get grapes?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:23.879
Are they good?

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:26.720
By the way,

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:29.360
is what Young Master Pan said about the Miasma Forest

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.080
true?

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.960
Six people entered the Miasma Forest and vanished.

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:36.799
The authorities only say it's ghosts causing trouble.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.399
I'll go investigate the matter tomorrow.

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.679
I'll go with you.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.480
Who knows what might happen in the forest.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.919
You stay at the Benevolent Peace Hall.

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:51.159
Don't worry.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.679
I'll protect myself.

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:55.600
Once we're in the forest,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.159
stay close to me.

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:00.480
It's getting chilly.

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:01.759
Put this on.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.559
Young Master Pan definitely has feelings for Royal Sister.

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:07.679
Look,

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.320
he's putting a cloak on her right now.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:20.639
But Royal Sister saved him today.

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:22.440
Young Master Pan gave him his coat.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.320
It was likely just a gesture of gratitude.

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:31.159
Luckily, I had a quick idea and played dead immediately.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320
That's how I escaped disaster.

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:33.679
There really are such things.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:34.240
Right.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.440
This is the first time I've heard of it.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.000
Another time,

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:41.240
I broke my leg while gathering lingzhi mushrooms.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.919
Fortunately, in the mountain stream at that time,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.559
there was a creek.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.480
We're in for a good show.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.799
I survived by drinking water from that creek,

00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:47.519
and held out for a full half month.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.840
So it turns out a person

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.080
can survive just by drinking water.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.720
What are you talking about?

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.480
Let me listen too.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:52.919
Miss A Zi and I

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.600
were talking about my early adventures in the martial world.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.000
A Zi.

00:14:55.679 --> 00:14:57.240
I just bought you new shoes and socks.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.879
Would you like to go back to your room and try them on?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.960
I'll try them later.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.080
Young Master Pan,

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:05.720
tell us more about your time in the Northern Frontier Desert.

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:08.000
The Northern Frontier Desert

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.480
is really quite different from Jiangnan.

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:11.200
Seventh Cousin, really.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.399
What took him so long?

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:16.039
You seem to understand

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:17.240
Zixiu's feelings quite well.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.519
Of course.

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.000
Miss A Zi is highly skilled.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.440
Could you teach me some time?

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:30.120
Mosquitoes.

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:32.960
There are too many mosquitoes in this courtyard.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:33.799
A Zi,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.799
you should go back to your room and rest early.

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:36.360
It's fine.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.600
Young Master Pan,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.799
didn't you say your chess skills were passable?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.120
How about we have a match?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.399
Alright.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:47.320
Let's go.

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:52.159
Seventh Cousin, get some rest early.

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:08.919
Had enough of the show?

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.799
Let's go.

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:36.000
My foot injury is fine now.

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.120
I'll go with you to the Miasma Forest to investigate.

00:16:40.159 --> 00:16:40.919
I've made inquiries.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.720
The six people who disappeared in the Miasma Forest

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:43.919
didn't offend anyone.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.480
If it really was man-made,

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:47.879
the other party probably wasn't seeking revenge.

00:16:49.159 --> 00:16:50.320
The first person to disappear

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.960
was two months ago.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.879
Take this Antidote Pill before entering the Miasma Forest.

00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:59.240
It will protect you from the miasma.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.200
Remember,

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.440
unless absolutely necessary,

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:02.799
do not use your internal energy.

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:04.279
to prevent the poison from attacking your heart.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.680
Are you really going into that Miasma Forest

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.400
to find those six missing people?

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.319
Isn't the government offering a hefty reward?

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.480
I'll go with you.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.519
I don't believe in those ghost stories either.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.279
Young Master Pan,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.920
you don't have to risk yourself by coming with us.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.720
If I hadn't developed the antidote,

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:26.200
the people in the city

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.440
wouldn't have run into the Miasma Forest.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.799
Then please, Young Master Pan,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
accompany us on this trip.

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:36.240
Young Master Pan,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.759
have you ever heard of

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:38.839
the Celestial Frostbloom?

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:41.440
Celestial Frostbloom?

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:44.160
I've never heard of that.

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:45.640
What you're talking about, miss,

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.359
I just read about it in a miscellany book.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.480
I heard this flower blooms once a century,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.400
and bears fruit once a millennium.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.640
It can reverse aging.

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:57.559
It's extremely precious.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.000
It's a flower?

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.480
The name is interesting, though.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.119
Let's go.

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:44.160
Is that the Celestial Frostbloom?

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:47.759
In those melodramatic plays,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.279
strange flowers always grow on cliffs.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.440
But how do you pick them?

00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:57.160
Wait for me a moment.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.880
Young Master Pan said not to use internal energy.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.960
Young Master Yuwen, what are you...

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.799
Careful!

00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:30.559
You're going to pick that flower?

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.519
I know your martial arts are superb,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.200
but what if...

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.759
Don't do that again next time.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.400
Miss A Lan likes this flower.

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:04.519
What flower?

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:05.759
You're holding it like a treasure.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.680
Didn't I tell you?

00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:09.119
The celestial herb blooms once a century,

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:09.960
and bears fruit once a millennium.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:10.880
It's extremely precious.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.559
Um, Miss A Lan...

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.039
This flower is called Pig-Ignoring Flower.

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:23.680
Pi... Pig-Ignoring Flower?

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.839
They're all over the hills of Tianyin City.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.599
They can't be used in medicine or eaten.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.839
Even wild boars dislike them.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.839
That's why they're called Pig-Ignoring Flower.

00:20:32.839 --> 00:20:33.960
Pig-Ignoring...

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.160
But A Lan likes it.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.519
Be careful.

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.160
Don't get separated.

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:37.359
This...

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.759
We're back where we started.

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:47.279
This place is truly bizarre.

00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:49.319
We should leave as soon as possible.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.680
The side with sparse tree rings is south.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.039
Let's head that way.

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:13.759
Miss A Lan is truly clever.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.920
I read it in a miscellany book.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.640
A ghost!

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.079
Go!

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:23.200
Go!

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.279
Look!

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.880
Stay close to me.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.000
He's poisoned.

00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:40.240
Thi... this is Carpenter Li from the north of the city.

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:41.920
One of the six missing people.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.839
What's wrong with him?

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.200
Judging by these symptoms,

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.440
it seems he consumed a large amount of Five-Fold Poison Herb.

00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:58.839
The poison has invaded his internal organs.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.480
That's why he's unconscious.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200
Five-Fold Poison Herb?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.400
Five-Fold Poison Herb is both medicine and poison.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:06.839
It can counteract miasma poison.

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:08.799
But it can also invade the internal organs.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.480
Consuming this herb,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.400
one can only wait for the poison to attack the heart.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.000
When the poison takes effect,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400
it feels like ten thousand worms gnawing your bones.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.359
It is a fate worse than death.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.480
An ordinary person

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.119
could not endure the suffering of this poison.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.000
They would rather commit suicide.

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:23.839
I didn't expect that Tianyin City

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:24.839
would actually have the Five-Fold Poison Herb.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.599
I had only seen it in books before.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.079
Is there a way to wake him up?

00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:57.319
The toxicity has been temporarily suppressed.

00:24:58.119 --> 00:24:59.039
I will try when we get back

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.119
to see if I can wake him.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.079
Let's stay here for the night.

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:38.240
Ghost!

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:45.000
Ghost!

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.000
Miss Lin!

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.240
Ghost!

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:52.680
Miss Lin!

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.880
Young Master Pan, are you alright?

00:25:59.039 --> 00:25:59.720
I'm fine.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.480
Lin Siqing... Ghost!

00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:05.079
Why did he call out Siqing's name?

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:07.880
Ghost!

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.799
Could it be that Siqing...

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:11.920
Young Master Pan.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.240
How did Miss Lin pass away?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.720
A few months ago,

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.519
Siqing died saving commoners who fell into the water.

00:26:25.599 --> 00:26:27.039
I was practicing medicine out of town at the time.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.799
Kind neighbors helped with the burial.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.279
Why would Siqing...

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.480
A Zi.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.039
Drink some water.

00:26:58.559 --> 00:26:59.240
Young Master Pan,

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:01.000
I heard that

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.400
you have stayed in Tianyin City

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.960
because Miss Lin liked it here.

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:08.759
After we got married,

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.759
we intended to travel the world.

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:12.279
Who would have thought

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:13.519
that once we came to Tianyin City,

00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:15.319
she wouldn't want to leave.

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:19.480
At that time, Tianyin City was in decline.

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:27.799
Brother Yu,

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:30.640
let's live here from now on.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.880
We can plant some herbs in the yard,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.160
and that room will be for you to refine medicine.

00:27:37.319 --> 00:27:38.480
The people of Tianyin City

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:39.680
do not live past forty.

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.799
Everyone else wants to stay far away,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.559
but you,

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:44.079
you insist on staying.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.200
But after we arrive,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.160
things will be different.

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.480
I think that in the future,

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:54.039
everyone in Tianyin City will live a long life.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.000
If you refine some

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.359
medicine to cure the miasma,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.279
this place will become beautiful,

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:01.599
full of birdsong and fragrant flowers.

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:03.880
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:26.400
I don't know where she got the courage

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.519
to say she wanted to turn Tianyin City

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:29.960
into a paradise.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.480
Her pitiful medical skills

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.720
were learned from me when she was bored.

00:28:35.599 --> 00:28:37.079
I heard from the apprentice at Benevolent Peace Hall

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.920
that Miss Lin once helped the locals

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:41.480
drive away a band of robbers.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.200
She always had clever ideas.

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:47.000
Miss Lin had a kind heart.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.079
No wonder the people in the city

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:50.920
respected her so much.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.680
They all said she was innocent and kind.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.839
But I thought she was silly.

00:28:59.119 --> 00:28:59.960
She always poured out

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.799
all her enthusiasm and kindness.

00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:04.920
If she had thought of herself a little,

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:07.039
perhaps...

00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:09.839
perhaps she wouldn't have

00:29:09.839 --> 00:29:11.519
lost her life saving others.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:07.799
I'm not cold.

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:09.640
Thank you, Seventh Cousin.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.240
You don't need to be so polite with me.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.720
If you have no feelings,

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.920
do not let people misunderstand for no reason.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.559
I understand.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:53.039
What are you thinking about?

00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:58.000
If my deduction is correct,

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:00.680
this matter is related to Shadow Sect Yunshang.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.079
Yunshang?

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:07.039
The wound on Carpenter Li's wrist

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.920
must have been caused by the Ice-Soul Silver Thread.

00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:13.880
Just now in the woods,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.440
the woman in white we met

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:16.200
was very likely

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.519
dressed up as Miss Lin.

00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:20.000
That is why Carpenter Li was so scared,

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.039
thinking he saw a ghost.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.480
But why would she do that?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.400
And what role does Yunshang

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:29.720
play in all of this?

00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:30.480
Alright,

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:31.400
stop thinking about it.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.799
I will investigate thoroughly when we get back

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:35.880
the cause of Lin Siqing's death.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:43.960
Husband,

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:45.559
you're back.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.279
Why are you so late today?

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:52.319
Is everything alright?

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:11.079
What's wrong?

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:20.279
It's getting late.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.440
Let's rest early.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.920
Carry me over there.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:03.519
Why are you acting strange today?

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.039
Am I?

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.239
Mo'er and the others are asleep.

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.719
It's not that late yet.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.360
Why don't we...

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.920
This dream is so realistic.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.960
What's wrong, Husband?

00:35:01.159 --> 00:35:02.519
Are you going to hurt me?

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:26.880
A Lan.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:27.960
A Lan.

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:29.880
A Lan, wake up.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.280
A Lan.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.079
We have entered an illusion.

00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:48.360
An illusion?

00:35:55.159 --> 00:35:55.840
Fourth Sister.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.880
Zixiu.

00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:57.440
Fourth Sister.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:57.840
Zixiu.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:58.960
Fourth Sister.

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:13.599
Siqing, Siqing.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.159
Just now...

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.000
It must be a dream designed to immerse people

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.039
so they don't want to wake up.

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:28.719
I once read in a medical book

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.679
that some plants can cause hallucinations,

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:32.800
making people indulge in them and refuse to wake.

00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:38.440
Could this flower be what caused our illusion?

00:36:45.239 --> 00:36:46.079
The soil has been turned.

00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:47.679
Someone planted it here on purpose.

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:04.159
The people who went missing earlier in the Miasma Forest

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:06.559
might have also come to this house.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:11.960
You all sleep first.

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:13.159
I'll keep watch.

00:37:14.039 --> 00:37:15.280
At dawn, we'll look around.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.639
You're injured.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.639
Just a flesh wound.

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:34.599
It's nothing.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:54.880
There.

00:38:08.159 --> 00:38:09.800
That illusion is born from one's heart's desire.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.519
What did you see in the illusion?

00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:21.159
I saw nothing.

00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:25.400
And you?

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.079
What did you see in the illusion?

00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:32.360
Taking a wife and having children.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.119
Taking a wife and having children.

00:38:38.679 --> 00:38:39.559
I never would have thought...

00:38:39.559 --> 00:38:40.280
what you can't forget...

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.559
is actually taking a wife and having children.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.800
What kind of wife...

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.840
was she in your illusion?

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.159
Beautiful as a goddess.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.519
Gentle and lovely.

00:38:52.039 --> 00:38:52.679
I'm very curious.

00:38:53.159 --> 00:38:54.039
Just gossip.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.679
I wonder which family's daughter...

00:38:56.679 --> 00:38:57.880
was so misguided...

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.840
as to marry you.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.320
What was your wife's name?

00:39:08.159 --> 00:39:09.840
Why are you looking at me?

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.159
If I don't say it...

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:16.920
you'll never know in your lifetime.

00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:21.320
Other than you...

00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:25.800
who else would I take as my wife?

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.280
The person I saw in the illusion was you.

00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:35.679
The one I wanted to marry was also you.

00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:37.519
It is now...

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280
and will be in the future.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.840
I never thought about it before...

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.760
taking a wife and having children.

00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:54.440
Leading troops into battle to kill the enemy...

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.039
What I thought about...

00:39:56.679 --> 00:39:57.800
was whether I'd die on the battlefield.

00:39:59.119 --> 00:39:59.840
After returning...

00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:02.079
I thought about avenging my parents.

00:40:05.039 --> 00:40:06.079
It wasn't until I met you...

00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:11.639
that I felt the days to come...

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.119
could take on other, hopeful shapes.

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:22.159
I...

00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:23.159
A Lan...

00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:34.280
Would you be willing to grow old with me in this life?

00:41:25.719 --> 00:41:27.079
The woman who grows old with you...

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:30.519
will not be me.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.360
In the illusion...

00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:39.400
you called out my name.

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:20.880
So you really did see me.

00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:29.159
I did see you.

00:42:34.039 --> 00:42:35.079
You told His Majesty...

00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:38.079
you agreed to cancel our engagement.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.639
In my heart...

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.400
I am very pleased.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.280
I'll go rest first.

00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:11.119
The woman who grows old with you...

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.440
will not be me.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.519
You told His Majesty...

00:43:20.519 --> 00:43:21.800
you agreed to cancel our engagement.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.039
In my heart...

00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:27.039
I am very pleased.
