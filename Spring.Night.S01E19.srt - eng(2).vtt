00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.120
Your Majesty,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.400
I'm fine.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.080
Let the imperial physician

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400
examine you first.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.280
I'm fine.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.560
Seeing you,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.160
all my ailments vanish.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.080
How is his condition?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.880
Your Majesty,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.080
the Crown Prince's pulse
is deep and rough.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.480
It shows poor blood circulation,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.480
a sign of blockage and stagnation.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.160
I fear his brain was injured,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.320
resulting in memory loss.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.200
Medication isn't advisable now.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.560
Are there other treatment methods?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.680
We can only wait for His Highness

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.960
to recover gradually.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.360
You may leave.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.080
Yes.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.480
My son,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.400
I have let you suffer.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.160
Tell me,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.480
who exactly harmed you?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.200
I don't remember.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.120
I can't recall anything.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.560
So,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.600
I am truly the Crown Prince?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.880
Your Majesty,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.760
are you my father?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.080
You've just recovered from illness.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.320
You still need

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.200
more time to rest.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.520
Oh, by the way,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.960
I heard

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.720
you married a commoner
while living among the people.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.680
Yes.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.720
Her name is Mai Tian.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.760
She saved your life,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.000
which is a great deed.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.280
I can ensure her wealth and status,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.600
but your marriage to her

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.720
should be considered null and void.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.480
No.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.280
Mai Tian is my lawfully wedded wife.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.600
What lawful wedding?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.920
For a prince to marry,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.632
a ritual must be held
at Ancestral Temple.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.200
How could a hasty marriage
among commoners count?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.800
This marriage is invalid.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.600
Your Majesty,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.520
you say I am the Crown Prince.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.000
I have not accepted this identity.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.880
But the fact
that I am Mai Tian's husband

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.120
will never change.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.360
There are still positions
for concubines in the Eastern Palace.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.280
Your Majesty, this is
absolutely unacceptable!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.920
The Crown Prince was saved by a commoner

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.320
and took refuge in a village.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.320
If you wish

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.360
to repay her life-saving grace,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.680
just reward her with money,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.000
and ensure her livelihood.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.600
Allowing a rustic village woman

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.080
to enter the royal family

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.880
is surely...

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.480
We'll discuss this later.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.680
As for this woman...

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.720
Your Majesty,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.720
this is non-negotiable.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.080
Unbelievable!

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.640
Go!

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.720
Bring Shen Zhifeng to me!

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.760
Yes!

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.600
Father.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.880
You dare show your face to me?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.280
Why wouldn't I?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.360
Do you know

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.400
that the person you saved back then

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.320
was Shen Jinyuan's son, Shen Zhifeng?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.360
He deceived me too.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.080
Father,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.920
it is not the time to assign blame.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.320
The fact that the Crown Prince is alive

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.000
is already irreversible.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.280
Fortunately,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.760
the Crown Prince has amnesia.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.400
As long as I can make him believe

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.360
that we are a devoted couple,
bound by unbreakable love,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.880
then all previous events

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.160
will cease to be a threat.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.200
My guests,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.360
your dishes are ready.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.280
Please enjoy.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.520
I heard this year's

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.920
top scorer, Ye Wuming,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.160
is the Crown Prince
who went missing some time ago.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.560
Speaking of which,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.920
that Crown Princess
is truly a pitiful woman.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.800
She was to endure the pain of widowhood.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.960
Now the Crown Prince is back
and lost his memory,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.880
not to mention

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.400
he has a wife outside the palace.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760
So now, who will be

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.560
the primary wife and who the secondary?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.920
One is a noble lady,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.160
the other a country woman.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.080
Of course, he should choose
the noble lady!

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.680
Such a fickle man!

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.080
He seduces and abandons!

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.800
The old saying is right.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.080
Men change for the worse
with money and power.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.080
No way.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.280
I need to hear him explain it
to me personally.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.160
Waiter!

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.200
Leaving the money here.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.800
Got it! Take care!

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.080
I'm actually the Crown Prince?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.960
And I have a Crown Princess?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.400
How do I explain this to Mai Tian?

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.560
Out.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.400
I don't want it.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.000
I said,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.760
out.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.560
I'm not used to palace drinks.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.160
Tell the Emperor

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.880
exactly this.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.880
Why are you scoffing? I said get out!

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.160
Mai Tian?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880
How did you get in?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.040

Stop it.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.160
Don't touch me.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.480
Answer my question first.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.760
