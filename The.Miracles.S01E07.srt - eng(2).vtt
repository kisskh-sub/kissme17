00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:51.640
Everyone, everyone

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.840
Good morning

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.119
You all should have seen

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.840
the notice at the village entrance

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.159
Shengliqiang Group

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:00.079
plans to develop one of our villages here

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.280
and they just happened to pick us

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.640
That's good news!

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.879
What does it say on there?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.120
Compensation of 2.5 times the area

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.040
Elevator apartments!

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.239
Don't talk nonsense

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.560
and brag here

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.560
Elder Brother

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.879
Didn't I come here

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.319
to ask for everyone's opinion?

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:20.840
Come on, everyone

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:22.480
I, Pengzai

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.439
grew up in this village

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.760
Everyone knows

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400
how bad our living conditions are

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.319
Damp, leaking water, faulty wiring

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.879
Your house is built all haphazardly

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:33.560
Isn't it?

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.400
But if you trick us

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.079
and then sell us out to others

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.239
What then?

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.239
There are laws, you know

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.840
You think they'd just act recklessly?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.640
Great-Uncle here has a higher understanding

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.879
This world has laws

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.760
This Shengliqiang Group

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.159
has built many

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.599
very famous buildings

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:51.640
Did you all watch

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.879
Hong Kong, China TV the other day?

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.519
Those curved ones

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.840
the houses with green glass

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920
You mean

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.879
the kind as pretty as Wan Chai?

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:01.000
That kind of house, right?

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.200
Great-Uncle, not Wan Chai

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.480
It's Repulse Bay

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.719
High-end residences!

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.640
In the future, we'll have

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.840
our own Repulse Bay right here

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.800
Right?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.400
If everyone in our village

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.719
votes and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.159
all agrees to it

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.080
They said they'll build a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.199
very large community

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.879
and give one building

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.240
to our village

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.840
A whole building!

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.479
For us to share!

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.439
No way, Pengzai

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.639
You think one building will settle us?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.919
To be honest

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.560
how much are you really trying

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.479
to sell us for?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.840
Elder Brother

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.800
It's not us selling to others

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.800
It's others who want us

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:38.840
and are giving us a good deal!

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.560
Come on, everyone

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.199
On behalf of our village

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.280
I'm first gauging your opinions

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.639
to see if you agree with this proposal

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.439
I'm the first to oppose it

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.400
Linlin

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.840
You're back

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.319
Dad

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.639
I'm going inside to do my homework

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:10.479
What did you say to Uncle Tao?

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.000
Thank you, Uncle Tao

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.199
Bite the hand that feeds you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.120
Thanks a lot

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.919
The way you're doing this

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.240
isn't a long-term solution either

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.360
Linlin asked me today

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.879
when Mom is coming back

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.360
So I could only tell her

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:26.879
I don't know

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.520
Why did you two really divorce?

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.599
You should have listened to everyone's advice back then

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.159
and found a local girl

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.439
People from outside probably just can't get used

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.360
to life here

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.960
Just you wait

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.919
When the time comes and this whole area

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.800
has tall buildings built up

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.919
and we move into apartments

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.719
she'll be too envious for words

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.240
Get me into your company too

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.879
How about it?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.199
I've asked for you several times

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.159
HR says the minimum education

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.680
is junior high school graduation

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.520
Better to just keep driving my motorcycle taxi

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.639
A Tao

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.400
Do me a favor

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.879
Several households in the village now

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.680
aren't signing

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.000
The most troublesome one is

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.199
that cousin of yours

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.879
Help me out

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.079
Don't drag me into this

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.240
He hits people

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.079
I know

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.240
He hit you

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.120
Close enough

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.360
Pengzai.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.720
They're not here, I can't decide.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.199
That's okay.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.160
When they come back tonight,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.560
you can discuss it with them.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.399
A Peng.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.000
You don't work at the factory anymore?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.879
You're doing this now?

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.360
I quit that a long time ago.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.279
No future in it.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:47.040
I was just thinking

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.920
you could introduce me

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.399
to get a job at your factory.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.079
Auntie Lan.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.639
This is the way out.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:53.879
The petition.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.680
A Peng.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.600
When will we

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.519
get to live in a tall building?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.560
Soon, very soon.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.560
Director Jia.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.240
It's a shame you weren't at my village yesterday.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.399
What a pity.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.240
I stood up there,

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.040
said my piece, and everyone agreed.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.079
Almost the whole village voted yes.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.040
Right now,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.319
aside from a few signatures

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.199
that are still

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.720
Don't worry.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.600
I'll overcome any difficulties.

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:17.560
Good.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.800
Take a look at this reclamation map.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.000
Do you know how hard it was

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.920
for me to secure this opportunity for your village?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.759
How difficult?

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.600
I know, I know.

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:26.879
You know your village's situation best.

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:27.639
You understand it the most.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:28.639
Roofs leak.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:29.519
Power cuts in the middle of the night.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.199
With such a great opportunity,

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.879
some people still refuse?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.040
They're just asking for trouble.

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:35.959
Honestly.

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:37.319
Those folks won't listen no matter what I say.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.519
You're speaking Cantonese to me again.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.560
I can't understand.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.279
What I mean is,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.920
I'll get the signatures

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.240
from the whole village

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.079
to the group as fast as possible.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.399
The doctor said

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:48.879
your foot doesn't need medicine.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.920
You just need to leave this bungalow

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.120
and move into a building.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.360
That'll fix everything.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.240
Modern buildings

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.439
don't need you to climb stairs.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.560
They have elevators.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:59.399
You get on,

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:00.720
*beep, beep, beep*

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.720
What's wrong?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.240
Go to other houses first.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.439
My cousin might not

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.560
be back anytime soon.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.279
I'll deal with him when he gets back.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.879
Uncle Pan.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.120
Once you sign this,

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.800
from then on,

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.120
you won't have to farm so hard.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.120
Hard work?

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.439
What's the damn use of hard work?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.879
Look at this field.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.199
I don't know what happened,

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.879
but the alkalization gets worse every year.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.680
Yeah.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.839
Nothing grows well anymore.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.199
You've already realized it.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.399
While someone wants it now,

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.279
give up the land,

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.279
and you can still get some money.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.839
The whole village has signed.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.920
You're the only one left.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.319
Director Wang.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.319
Good morning.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.240
Wang...

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.240
Director Wang's office is here, right?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.639
He's not in.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.879
Um...

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.560
Sir.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.240
Do you know when Director Wang will be back?

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.879
How should I know?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.000
Come back another day.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.120
Sir.

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:19.319
Director Wang, this map...

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:20.680
Our company

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:21.879
has the exact same one

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:22.759
posted in our office.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.360
Seems Director Wang and I are fated to meet.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.560
Sir.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.439
I heard Director Wang

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.639
is a very warm-hearted person.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.079
He's willing to help with anything you ask.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.639
Right?

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:36.720
That depends on what it is.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.399
Thank you, sir.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.000
How about this, sir.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.160
I'll

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.000
take the trash down

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.079
and throw it out for you on my way.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.839
Don't touch it! Don't!

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:47.319
Really, no need.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.240
You're too eager.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.000
I worked hard to collect these.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.519
They're all samples.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.920
You should head back now.

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:54.839
Come another day.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.000
If you want this,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.439
next time I come,

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:56.759
Director Wang!

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:57.199
Oh, there you are.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.439
There's a document here for you to sign.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.000
Director Wang

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.480
Um...

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:27.000
I... I just wanted

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.040
to come over

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.439
and ask for your advice

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.279
regarding the eco-reclamation project.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.440
Our group,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.480
is quite well-known in Shenzhen.

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:35.120
We've done several benchmark projects.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.200
Please wait for me.

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.360
Thank you.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:42.559
Development requires land.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.840
So we thought about eco-reclamation.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.200
This is also

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.000
all benefit and no harm.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.279
Who told you that?

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:52.879
That it's all benefit and no harm?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.279
Our company's Director Jia said so.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.679
She said that nowadays, those

00:08:57.799 --> 00:08:59.080
wealthy groups abroad,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.440
when they develop,

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:01.799
they all develop towards the coast.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.519
Reclaiming land from the sea,

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.240
expanding Earth's resources.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.919
You're quite earnest.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.000
Just thinking

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:11.840
if it really gets built,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360
it would be a good thing

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:14.919
for us villagers too.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600
You're from this village, right?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.919
Yes, a local.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:18.960
That makes it easier then.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.039
Come back another day.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.799
I have another meeting.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.240
Nowadays, everywhere

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.159
welcomes investment.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.879
And besides, we

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:25.120
have policy support.

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:26.720
It's just that Environmental Bureau,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
dragging its feet.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.000
Exactly!

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.399
He wants you to go again.

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:34.519
What does that mean?

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:35.840
I don't get it either.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.919
When you went,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.759
what did you bring?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.759
Today, I...

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:42.559
I went empty-handed.

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:44.759
My client manager,

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.879
you're using thin air

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.519
to serve a client?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.399
I was just scouting the situation!

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.000
I see, I see.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.799
Dad.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.799
The teacher asked us to draw

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.960
a different kind of beneficial insect.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.440
I don't know what to draw.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:08.559
Beneficial insects...

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.320
Well, dragonflies,

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:13.519
ladybugs,

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:14.320
praying mantises,

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:14.919
they all count.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.879
Those are all too common.

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.559
I want something different.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:20.720
Something different.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.080
Draw a mangrove frog.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.279
They've definitely never seen one.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.519
Is a mangrove frog a beneficial insect?

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.399
Yes, it is.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:33.159
But I've never even seen a mangrove frog.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.879
How could you not have seen one?

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:35.919
There are tons of them

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:37.360
under that mangrove forest outside.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.360
When you were little and trying to sleep,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.399
you always said,

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:41.799
"It's so noisy!"

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:43.600
That was the mangrove frogs.

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:45.480
Mom said they were toads.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.360
What does she know?

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:52.200
Then I'll draw a mangrove frog.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:53.759
Take me to see one.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.360
Oh my god.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:07.639
Who's so heartless?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.879
Dumping so much trash here.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:13.519
In the past,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.039
under these trees,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.279
these roots and leaves were full of mangrove frogs.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:18.639
Dad.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.039
It's been over an hour.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:22.000
We haven't seen a single frog.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.879
Don't worry.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:25.879
I know this place well.

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:27.919
Maybe...

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.720
maybe they're hibernating.

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:30.720
Sleeping.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.080
It's summer now.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.039
Is it?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.519
They're definitely here.

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:37.600
Linlin, here's what we'll do.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.240
Let's close our eyes.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:40.840
Listen carefully.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.039
See if you can hear

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:42.919
the sound of mangrove frogs.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.240
Dad.

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:47.639
It stinks here.

00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:49.120
I'm scared.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.480
I want to go home.

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:52.240
Okay.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.480
Another day, I'll catch one and show you.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.360
See it?

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:01.519
That's a mangrove frog.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.919
A mangrove frog, that's a mangrove frog.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.159
Sketch it, sketch it.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:05.320
I'll catch it for you to see.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.600
Got it.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.039
It's dead.

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:20.960
Dad.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.559
Could this be the last

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.120
mangrove frog here?

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.600
How could that be?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.799
As long as the mangroves are here,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.679
there will definitely be mangrove frogs.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.639
But Grandpa said

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.799
when he was little,

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.320
there were even tigers in Shenzhen.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.279
They're gone now too, aren't they?
