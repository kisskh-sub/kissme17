00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.500
I'm darn useless.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.100
So thin the wind just blows right through.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.340
It's fine. I have you here.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.420
When a typhoon comes, I won't hide.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.379
I'll just hold onto you.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.579
If not a typhoon, then what? Drink the north wind?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.459
Last Mid-Autumn Festival, we ate river snails.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.019
This year on my birthday, it's sea snails again.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.219
What about next year?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.980
Do you have a grudge against me,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.980
or against snails?

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.060
Well, you married

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.180
a fishmonger, didn't you?

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:27.819
How do you know he sells fish?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.260
Just a wild guess.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.180
One last year of snails.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.739
Next year, abalone.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.060
No problem.

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:35.459
Alright then.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.260
You brush me off every single time.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:38.819
It's pointless. That's it.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:41.140
Then what do you want me to do?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.299
If we can't make it,

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:43.540
then we won't.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.060
Hong Fu.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.859
Check, please.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.500
Two herbal teas,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.379
one plate of river snails.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.459
That'll be eight yuan.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.180
Come on, come on.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:56.099
How about another order of fried clams?

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:56.819
On the house.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.739
No.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.099
I like eating snails.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:00.739
He wants to go to Fortune's Gate.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.420
Gets a little money and forgets

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.739
which way is up.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.739
Fortune's Gate Grand Restaurant.

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:06.579
It's not cheap.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.060
It's not like I can't afford it.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.300
I'll collect rent for two days,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.259
and I'll be back.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.099
I have the keys to half a street's worth of houses

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.939
right here.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.419
Let's eat something good.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.659
All thanks to our village.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.780
Developing and building.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.099
That's how a loser like you turned things around.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.139
You really think you're a property king now.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.500
Just indulge

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.060
this loser of yours.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.659
Let's have some double-head abalone.

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.139
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.979
Since its establishment in 1980,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.580
it has become the forefront of China's reform and opening-up

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.939
and a globally renowned

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.219
city of innovation.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.060
People from all corners of the country

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.379
gather in Shenzhen,

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:21.340
realizing

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.139
miracles in their lives.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.900
Hong Fu, let's go.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.580
Thank you.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.340
Take care, sir.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.060
Here, beer.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.099
Boss, sit anywhere.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.659
Be right there.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:40.539
Here.

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.780
Thanks.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.180
Sit anywhere.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.500
Here.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.300
Put it here.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.340
Pretty lady, where are you from?

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.139
What does it matter where I'm from?

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.699
Is the price different?

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.539
No, it's the same everywhere.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:55.259
What'll you have?

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.419
Any recommendations?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.500
From all over the land,

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.219
our shop proudly offers a signature mixed noodles.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.219
A pioneering fusion of northern and southern flavors.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.580
No matter how far from home you are,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.219
you'll taste a bit of home.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.819
It even has a beautiful name.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:07.300
Called

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.500
"Three Thousand Miles of Mortal Dust."

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.259
Northerners eat it and praise the flavor.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.699
Southern girls say it's darn delicious.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.340
One order, please.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.939
One order.

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:15.460
Wonton noodles.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.660
Wonton noodles, thanks.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:17.980
One wonton noodles.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.899
Two wonton noodles.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.220
Wait a second.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:22.899
Add pork cracklings.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:31.379
Alright, you got it.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.339
Those two are so stylish.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.019
The newspaper says this is called

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.699
"white-collar."

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.660
White-collar.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.500
Because their collars are whiter?

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.540
They're leaders who wear white shirts.

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:44.939
They're very particular.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.660
They'll definitely wipe the table first in a bit.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:48.540
It's already wiped.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.379
Boss!

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:51.899
Two more bottles of beer.

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:52.420
Coming!

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.500
Can you stop drinking?

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.860
You've had a lot.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.980
No way.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.100
I'm happy to see you today.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.500
So I have to drink more.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.060
Usually after my shift, I just slurp a bowl of noodles alone.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.139
Today, I've had eight bottles.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:04.939
What's the deal?

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.540
Driving a taxi pays pretty well.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.180
I think

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.500
he's probably trying to get back

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:12.259
with his ex-wife.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.620
Before, I was useless.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.699
Now it's different.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.899
I work steadily.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:20.579
Monthly earnings over ten thousand.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.860
Pick up Hong Kong, China passengers at Luohu Port,

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.100
drop off wholesalers at Huaqiangbei.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:25.860
Next year,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.699
I'll buy an apartment right in Lianhua Village.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:31.339
Cigarettes?

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:32.459
Quit.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:33.379
Alcohol?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.899
Only drink when I see you.

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:36.899
I just want you to see

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.139
I've changed a lot.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.860
But the one thing that hasn't changed

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.779
is this

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.939
heart that still cares for you.

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:48.459
I've forgotten.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:50.899
If I say I've forgotten, then I have.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.259
Deep down, I know better than anyone,

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.740
what's gone is gone.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:57.660
You and I haven't been

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.420
in the same car for a long time.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:00.779
The wheel's turned all the way.

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:02.420
No turning back.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.339
Anyway, Shige,

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.019
being able to see you again

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:12.819
makes me really happy.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.220
Really.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:18.819
Very happy.

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:37.459
Pork cracklings.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:49.540
Gotta say,

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.019
the SEZ speed

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.019
isn't that great?

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.899
Look how perfect they are for each other.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.100
I'm here, Shan Ge.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.019
How's it going?

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:33.300
Is everything taken care of?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.860
Don't worry, Shan Ge.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:36.740
The brake pads are changed.

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:38.100
The gas tank is full too.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:39.740
Won't cause any more trouble.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.500
What screws did you use?

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.259
Those hex socket ones strip easily.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.420
The external hex ones don't get enough torque.

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:47.699
It's tight.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:49.060
I told you.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.819
No more screw-ups.

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:52.100
Alright, alright, alright.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.019
Whatever it is, we'll talk face-to-face.

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:54.899
Remember

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:56.100
to bring the "good luck money".

00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:58.300
Time's about right.

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:12.579
Boss.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:13.779
Sit anywhere.

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:33.860
You guys just got off the construction site.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:36.019
Have some soup to nourish yourselves.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.259
Do I look like I need nourishing?

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.539
Go get the menu.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.379
Right away.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.340
Today, at a bank in Luohu District,

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:44.899
a major robbery occurred.

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:46.340
There were four robbers in total.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.340
We urge all citizens

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.340
to actively provide

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:01.019
Fu Ge.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.259
It's fine.

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:06.860
You go prep the ingredients.

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:08.100
I'll take care of them.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:08.899
Shan Ge.

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.259
The Type 79's recoil is half of the Type 54's.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.899
No other issues.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.460
Just the sights need adjusting.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.539
Shenzhen's weather is humid.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.940
When the gun oil gets damp,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.019
it turns sticky.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.220
If the gun oil is sticky,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.500
the lubrication is poor.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.139
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:24.019
If the lubrication is poor,

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:25.419
then it'll jam, won't it?

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:26.539
I'll smack you.

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:27.179
Enough.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:33.299
Don't talk about this here.

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:35.379
Later, find someone who knows guns

00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:36.019
and ask again.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.139
Come on, come on.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:37.940
Look at the map.

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:38.779
Everyone, look at the map.

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:40.779
From this Dongmen jewelry store

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:42.620
to the Shekou bonded zone,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.539
the whole route is thirty-two kilometers.

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.059
There are three high-risk points.

00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:47.659
Whether the tools work well now

00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:48.179
isn't important.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.139
There's only one rule:

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.179
Steady hands, ruthless heart, sharp eyes.

00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:52.980
Got it?

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:54.500
Our future depends on this.

00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:55.059
Let's take the gamble.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:55.980
If we succeed,

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.620
we'll live in wealth and glory forever.

00:09:57.659 --> 00:09:57.980
Come on.

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:00.139
Cheers.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.259
Ah Hong.

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:05.620
Not many people today, huh?

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.259
Lao Ma.

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:07.259
No rush, no rush, no rush.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.860
Let's you and I step out for a smoke first.

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:09.899
Let's go, let's go.

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:10.539
Not smoking.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.419
Quit.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.539
You should quit too.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.019
Look, your glabella is dark.

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.259
Your liver fire is raging.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.500
A Miao.

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:19.700
Business good?

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:21.779
I told my son,

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:23.580
"If you get into Shenzhen Middle School,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.899
I'll quit immediately."

00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:26.299
Guess what?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.500
That little rascal actually got in.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:30.980
What a coincidence, right?

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:32.539
Just got some fresh fish today.

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:33.899
Steam one to celebrate for you.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:34.659
Come on, come pick one.

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:35.059
No hurry, no hurry.

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:35.299
Go pick one.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.500
Make me a beef chow fun.

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:37.139
Miao Miao.

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:38.620
Here, change this for some herbal tea.

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:39.500
Okay.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.259
No, no need. I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:45.139
Back in the day,

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:45.860
when we were on stakeouts

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.139
catching motorcycle thieves,

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:49.259
it was so tiring.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:50.379
Covered in stinky sweat.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.259
That sweat could cure salted fish.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.379
Now it's better.

00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:55.259
Our dorm has air conditioning.

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:57.139
On night shifts,

00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:59.539
we can even eat chilled watermelon.

00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:02.100
Come on, come on.

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:07.620
You guys should install one too.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.139
This... install... install what?

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.539
Air conditioning.

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:11.860
Look outside.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.659
It's hot as a steamer.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.940
Alright.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:16.779
Alright.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.779
Got the house.

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:21.259
Son got into school.

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:23.740
Held back for so long.

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:25.779
Taking a sip shouldn't be a problem, right?

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.740
Pretty quick hands.

00:11:57.899 --> 00:11:58.379
Thanks.

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:02.220
You guys

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:07.700
are movers, right?

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.379
Something like that.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.299
Officer.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.700
How long have you been in this line of work?

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.580
One month short of thirty full years.

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:21.500
What's up?

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:24.379
Then you must understand everything.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.299
Just tell me,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.059
does the Type 79 really jam or not?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.980
Well...

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:45.500
It's been a very long time

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.100
since I've handled one.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:46.899
Not sure.

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.179
Why are you asking?

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:49.500
Just eat your meal properly.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.059
A Miao

00:12:57.539 --> 00:12:58.740
My buddies haven't eaten yet.

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.019
Pack four lunch boxes for them.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.779
You know the place, right?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:02.980
Go.

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:03.899
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.419
Is there any food left?
