WEBVTT

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.199
Your Majesty.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.039
This secret chamber
is concealed within the rockery.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:23.640
It is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160
reinforced with black iron stone,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.679
impervious to attacks.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.519
Your Majesty may take refuge here.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.000
Since the Shen family

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.439
conducted legitimate business,

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.679
why would they go to such lengths

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.280
to build a secret chamber like this?

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:45.439
There must be some hidden secret.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.000
What Your Majesty wishes to ask about

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.359
is the Shen family's
rumored treasure map, isn't it?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.039
Since the downfall of the Shen family,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.240
many parties

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.679
have searched for it, yet found nothing.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.799
Does Your Majesty believe

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.320
that the treasure map

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.119
is hidden inside this chamber?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.760
Your Majesty has deigned
to come here personally.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.000
Could it be to find the treasure map

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.319
and use it to confirm
the Shen family's crime of treason?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.640
You...

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.599
How dare you!

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:16.879
Under all heaven,

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.000
does any land not belong to the Emperor?

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.562
How could His Majesty

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.319
covet the Shen family's wealth?

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.840
Since you claim the Shen family
was wronged,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.680
then how do you explain

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.120
this fortune rivaling

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.239
a nation?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.840
Indeed.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.959
The Shen family does possess
a peerless treasure.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.920
It is right here in this secret chamber.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.120
Speak.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:19.162
=The Arcithect=

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.225

(I need only you)

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.100
(Shen Residence)

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.450
(Shen Residence)

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:36.675
(Shen Residence)

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:46.325
(A Treasure of Virtue and Jade)

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.319
Bring all the explosives up here.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.400
Blow this place up.

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.879
Pei Yu.

00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:56.919
This charge of plotting
to assassinate the Emperor

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.520
and usurp the throne

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.080
has still fallen upon you.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.000
This is an object of the imperial house.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.759
Please, Your Majesty,

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.639
personally lift the red silk.

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:32.919
(Pillar of the Nation's Commerce)

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.560
Father.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.039
This is...

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.039
It is His Majesty

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.520
rewarding our Shen family

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.680
for meritorious service
in quelling the rebellion.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.000
His Majesty personally
inscribed this plaque,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.919
and bestowed it upon Shen family.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.759
Such boundless imperial grace.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.400
Father,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.879
you rendered great service
to our family.

00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:51.462
(Pillar of the Nation's Commerce)

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:52.639
Ning,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
you must remember.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.520
The wealth of our Shen family

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.879
comes from the people,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.599
and is granted by imperial favor.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.280
So long as it is for Daliang,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.479
and to ease His Majesty's burdens,

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.120
even if we must give up all our wealth,

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.759
we must

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.360
do so without hesitation.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:16.519
This plaque...

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.000
Your Majesty,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.801
it is a golden plaque
personally bestowed

00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:22.399
by the late Emperor
upon the Shen family.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.560
The Shen family cherishes it
above all else,

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.199
passing it down through generations.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.319
The late Emperor's teachings

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.879
were engraved into our family precepts.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800
That is why the Shen family
specially built this chamber

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.240
to store this golden plaque.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.120
Yet rumors spread and grew distorted,

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:44.120
giving rise to the legend
of a Shen family treasure map.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.199
The world only knows

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.600
that the Shen family's wealth rivals
a nation,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.399
but they do not know
what the Shen family values most

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.879
is loyalty to the state

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.680
and kindness to the people.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.160
The late Emperor

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.040
rarely inscribed calligraphy,

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.199
yet he bestowed upon the Shen family

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.360
such an ink treasure.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:05.480
This shows

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.399
the trust the late Emperor placed
in the Shen family.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.160
The late Emperor

00:05:11.737 --> 00:05:12.774
also left words for me.

00:05:14.187 --> 00:05:15.784
"Accept remonstrance
and heed good counsel."

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.399
I was foolish.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:25.959
I promise you,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.480
the Shen family's case will be retried.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.639
We thank Your Majesty
for your great grace.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.759
Your Majesty, be careful!

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:42.200
(Pillar of the Nation's Commerce)

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.920
It must be Xiao Huaijin
leading troops to attack.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.079
He intends to use explosives
to destroy this secret chamber.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.519
The traitor Pei Yu

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.160
harbors treasonous intent,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.160
seeking to assassinate the Emperor.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.800
The palace is now without a ruler.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.839
Brothers!

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.519
Follow me and seize the palace!

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:58.639
Take the Imperial Seal!

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.519
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.115
(Pillar of the Nation's Commerce)
Rebellious scoundrels!

00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:06.263
I will tear them to pieces!

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.439
Your Majesty, please calm yourself.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.920
There is a hidden passage
in this chamber.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.360
I will lead Your Majesty there at once,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.120
to catch Xiao Huaijin off guard
and kill him.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.800
(Pillar of the Nation's Commerce)

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.680
Pei Yu.

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.399
Take a look, who is that?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.720
Sister.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.600
Consort Shu.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.399
Xiao Huaijin.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360
What do you want to do?

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.879
What do I want?

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.680
It's very simple.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:07.560
A life for a life.

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:12.600
Go kill that that despicable emperor
for me.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:15.800
Don't you understand?

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:19.480
That despicable emperor
has made your hands

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.879
soaked in blood.

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.120
How many crimes have you borne for him?

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.959
And now you would still

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.879
cause your own sister's death
for his sake?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.000
Your Majesty,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.279
do you still remember that year,

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.480
when pear blossoms were in full bloom?

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.199
You took me and Yu

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.720
out of the arena,

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.399
saving us from suffering.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.199
I once believed

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.160
that marrying the hero of my dreams

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.319
would be my lifelong destination.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.000
But I never imagined

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.079
that I would become

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.800
a weight on the scales.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.040
Yu.

00:08:04.687 --> 00:08:05.920
I was wrong.

00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:07.920
I should not have enjoyed

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.639
the splendor and riches
of the imperial house,

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.600
nor should I have hoped

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.560
for marital affection
within the imperial family.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.639
I should not have known full well

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.439
how much injustice you suffered,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.319
yet still fantasized

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.399
that His Majesty would change his heart.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.399
This is a vortex with no end,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.160
yet I still dragged you into it.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480
You don't need to be afraid.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.519
From today onward,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.000
there will be no one

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.279
who can bind you anymore.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.120
Sister.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.320
(Yu.)

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.565
(They all say)

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:50.120
(that once you enter the palace gates,
it is as deep as the sea.)

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.919
(I only wanted to stay
by His Majesty's side,)

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.600
(yet feared doing poorly
and being despised.)

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.840
(Sister, just do what you wish to do.)

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:32.919
(As for everything else,)

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.440
(I will help you.)

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.799
Sister!

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.200
My beloved consort!

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.879
Sister!

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:49.399
My beloved consort!

00:09:58.679 --> 00:09:59.360
Sister!

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.240
Sister!

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.679
Xi...

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:04.559
Xi Yan.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:05.200
Sister!

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.559
This is the keepsake my mother left

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.639
for me.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.320
Yu could meet you

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.919
is his good fortune.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.559
I entrust him to you.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.559
Yu.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.360
Sister.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.279
Sister.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:28.399
No.

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:30.279
The capital

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.360
is a place of endless strife.

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:34.320
Imperial will is unpredictable.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.200
Leave this place.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.559
Go to a place that belongs to you.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.000
Sister!

No, Sister!

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:47.080
Sister!

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:48.639
Sister!

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.240
Sister!

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:05.320

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.600

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:25.799
Your Majesty.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:26.879
Your Majesty.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.559
- Return to the palace.
- Let's go.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:35.360
Xiao Huaijin.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.759
Give me back my sister's life.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.600
Kill me.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.879
After you kill me,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.879
the Shen family case

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:49.639
will never be overturned.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.519
The entire Shen clan

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.960
will forever be branded as traitors
who colluded with the enemy.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.799
Come on!

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.600
The Shen clan

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.480
died by your hand,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.240
and you still want the Shen family

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.240
to bear infamy for eternity?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.559
Do you think the Shen family
was so virtuous?

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:11.399
They were nothing
but fame-seeking hypocrites.

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:13.519
Guarding wealth that rivaled a nation,

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:16.000
yet even at death's door
they refused to tell the truth.

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:18.679
Isn't that harboring
sinister intentions?

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.639
So it really was you
who secretly broke into the prison,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.399
failed to extract the treasure map,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.320
and slaughtered the entire Shen clan.

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:31.799
So what if I did?

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.960
Anyone who dares block me

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.720
deserves to die.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.720
Wait.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.399
This strike

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.240
is the price you pay
for killing Consort Shu.

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:01.320
This strike

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.799
is the price you pay
for killing my parents.

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:15.799
This strike

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:19.159
is the price you pay
for slaughtering the Shen clan.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.159
This strike

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.919
is the price you pay for killing Xi Yan.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.240
The final strike

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:51.080
is for the countless people

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.519
who suffered because
of your selfish desires.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.600
I will make you wish for death.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:57.480
