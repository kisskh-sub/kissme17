WEBVTT

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.280
Finally found you.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.039
Young Master.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.199
Princess, Meng Mansion's...

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.560
Young Master Meng.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.919
Master Meng, make yourself at home.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.560
I'll keep watch at the door.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.680
Do you know how hard I've searched for you?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.560
I've scoured the entire Luo Jing.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.680
I'm sorry, Young Master.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.080
I wrote you a letter.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.000
I didn't expect you wouldn't see it.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:01.759
Young Master.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.120
That title is too much for me.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.520
Fifth Princess.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.919
From now on, just call me Shaojue.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.240
I never expected...

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.840
...you were the one coveting my Blackie...

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.240
...the wicked Fifth Princess.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.400
That's all in the past.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.400
Who doesn't have some embarrassing past?

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.000
Alright.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.319
Have you missed me these past few days?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960
A Lan missed...

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.680
...thinking that I couldn't go to Meng Mansion...

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.080
...so I couldn't see Yinglu...

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.520
...or see Blackie...

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.639
...and couldn't eat the little pears from the little pear tree.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.960
Little pear tree?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.520
There's a little pear tree behind the garden.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.360
It's covered in beautiful little pears.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.800
The little pears are so sweet.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.479
The Fifth Princess should know...

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960
...that's not a pear tree.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800
It's a Sacred Fruit Tree, seen once in a century in the southern snow mountains.

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.000
That Sacred Fruit Tree is extremely precious.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.759
How does the Fifth Princess plan to make up for it?

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.680
How about... offering yourself in marriage?

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.680
Use me to pay for the sacred fruit.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:27.759
Not a good deal.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.759
How thoughtful of you to consider for me.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.240
Why did you keep pretending to be foolish?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.399
I didn't mean to deceive you and Yinglu.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.360
It's just that something happened in the palace.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.800
I had to act dumb and foolish for a while.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.360
I was planning to go to Meng Mansion to find you soon.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.959
I didn't expect you to find me first.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:57.120
The most favored Fifth Princess of Yunmi...

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.040
...was actually pretending to be an idiot in the palace...

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.680
...and came to my Meng Mansion to be a little pig-tending maid.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.079
It's a long story.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:08.480
I'll tell you slowly another time.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.360
By the way, about the pretending to be dumb...

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.000
...no one knows except my Royal Sister and them.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.959
Please keep it a secret for me.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.680
Since palace affairs are so complicated...

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.600
...why not just stay in my Meng Mansion?

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.279
I'll keep you safe.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.720
Lord Yuwen.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.959
The score between us...

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:31.920
...we'll settle properly later.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:33.759
Master Meng.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.040
What score?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.680
Why not settle it with this official?

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.439
Matters between A Lan and me...

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.120
...are none of your business.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.079
She is my betrothed wife.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.639
Her matters are my matters.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.920
Right, A Lan?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.720
A Lan?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.560
A Lan?

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.279
Yes, you're right.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.639
Whatever you say is right.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.439
My lord invited Yinglu over.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.240
I took the liberty of coming along. You don't mind, do you?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.399
Miss.

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:38.519
A Lan!

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.800
Stupid A Lan, silly A Lan!

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.519
Where did you go?

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:42.680
Why didn't you return to Meng Mansion?

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:44.240
Do you know how worried I've been about you?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.360
Miss, A Lan is fine.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
You're not foolish anymore.

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.160
The Fifth Princess has just regained her senses.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.519
Brother, what nonsense are you saying?

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:56.079
How could A Lan be the Fifth Princess?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.279
A Lan is just A Lan.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.199
A Lan?

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:12.079
A Lan really is the Fifth Princess.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.120
This cup's temperature is just right.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:28.959
Thank you.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.160
A Lan... Fifth Princess.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.240
How did A Lan become the Fifth Princess?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.879
Anyone but the Fifth Princess.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:41.319
Yinglu.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.519
Whether I'm the Fifth Princess or A Lan...

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.040
...I'm still your good friend.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.759
In my room...

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:54.120
...there are some martial arts manuals.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:55.680
If you like them...

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.240
...I'll pick a few for you to take back.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.720
How about it?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.560
Really?

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.639
Are they my martial arts manuals?

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.800
But since you've already moved in...

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.040
...they're yours.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.560
Then let's go quickly!

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.079
If there aren't any really amazing ones...

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:15.079
...I'll ignore you from now on.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.079
Don't worry.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.920
Where's Blackie?

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:26.920
How did it get outside the railing?

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:28.639
Good Blackie, come back quickly.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.720
There are lots of delicious pastries over there.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:31.839
Come back, I'll let you try some.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.080
You're not coming back, huh?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.600
Believe it or not, I'll leave you here...

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.720
...to keep Lord Yuwen company every day.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.960
To keep Lord Yuwen company day after day.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.879
Blackie is timid.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.799
Don't scare it.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.200
So it's timid, huh?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.639
I thought it was as brave and fearless as Master Meng.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.399
Alright, alright.

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.799
I'll go outside and bring it back.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.279
No need for such trouble.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.840
What would you like for lunch?

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:07.559
Meat!

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.960
What kind of meat?

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:14.360
Braised pork belly.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.320
What a spineless pig.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:33.480
With these...

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:35.559
...next time I see that guy named He...

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:37.279
...I'll beat him until he calls me 'Grandma'.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.039
Yinglu, you know Commander He is...

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:45.000
So he's that 'He the Little Bandit'!

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.679
I only just realized it.

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:49.120
That guy named He is too cunning.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.039
This is going from die-hard fan to anti-fan.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:57.159
Lord Yuwen really understands the Fifth Princess.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:02.879
These are all dishes the Fifth Princess likes.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.159
Naturally.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.399
I'm eating. Please don't mention me. Thank you.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240
Back at Meng Mansion,

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.679
Didn't the princess often have stomachaches?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.279
It's best to eat less of these greasy foods.

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:27.679
When did I...

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:28.559
I told you long ago,

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:31.399
food from outside isn't clean.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.720
When did you...

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.120
Loving meat is naturally a good thing.

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.559
But sometimes,

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.559
you should still try other things.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.320
Perhaps the taste

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:42.919
is even more delicious than meat.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:12.799
When I return to the palace,

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.080
I'll invite you all to visit.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.799
Blackie must be eager to go back.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:18.440
We'll take our leave now.

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:22.639
The gates of Meng Mansion are always open for you.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.960
It's a promise.

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.440
We're off now.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:27.679
Let's go.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.120
Leaving.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.759
My lord.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.399
This Young Master Meng has even pursued us to our villa.

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.799
Look how overjoyed the Fifth Princess is.

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:42.840
Look, even Xixi is on his side now.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.320
Princess.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.759
My lord, you... you...

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.080
Do you still have a chance?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.519
Here.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.879
Blackie won't get off the carriage.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.200
You can carry him back to the mansion later.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:23.960
Yes, Miss.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:27.039
Young Master Meng, Miss Meng.

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:29.759
What brings you here?

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:32.000
Commander He.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:34.039
I know all about you and Yinglu.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.320
I believe in your character.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.519
But I must warn you,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.720
if anyone dares to bully our Yinglu,

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:43.159
I will not let it go.

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:45.559
I understand.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.720
I came specifically to apologize today.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.559
I wonder if I could speak with Miss Meng alone for a moment.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.679
Say what you have to say, quickly.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120
This young lady is very busy.

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:03.279
Regarding the previous incident,

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:04.919
I, He, am at fault.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.120
I mentioned before

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.320
that I would recommend martial arts books to Miss Meng.

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:11.799
So I selected these few and brought them over.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:15.000
I hope Miss Meng can be magnanimous and not hold it against me.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.759
With these, I'll be able to defeat you.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.799
With just these few, absolutely impossible.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.519
Martial arts manuals like these,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in my home, fill three walls of four rooms.

00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:43.039
Books covering three walls in four rooms.

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:43.879
You've read them all?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.720
However,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.279
given Miss Meng's temperament,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.679
if you wanted to finish reading them all,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.159
a conservative estimate

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.480
would be fifty years.

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:54.360
Fifty years from now,

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:56.120
whether Miss Meng is still in this world

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.759
is hard to say, I'm afraid.

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:01.240
You said you came to apologize?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.799
I think you came deliberately to anger me!

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.039
Miss Meng.

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:06.000
Was I incorrect?

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.360
Correct, my foot!

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.600
I was blind!

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:11.399
I actually thought you were full of integrity back then,

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.559
and even took you as a role model.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.519
Miss Meng, where have I offended you this time?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.720
Get out!

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.919
No, I...

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:43.320
You come.

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:51.039
Princess.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.360
Last time you asked me

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:54.120
if I had something I wanted to do for myself.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:57.080
These past two days, I've figured it out.

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:09.200
What did you just say?

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:10.960
I said,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.600
I know what I want to do in the future.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.840
Back then,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.559
after my lord saved me from the sea of fire,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.600
I practiced swordplay day and night.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.399
Actually, it wasn't just

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.519
to be able to stay by my lord's side.

00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:22.679
More importantly,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.879
I wanted to become someone like my lord.

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:26.240
In times of war,

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.799
gallop on horseback, spear in hand, to battle the enemy.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.679
Protect our Yunmi in eternal peace.

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:31.679
In times of peace,

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.200
stationed in Luo Jing to deter all quarters,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.200
so that other nations never dare invade our Yunmi.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:42.360
I never imagined you were such a Ru Feng.

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:57.000
Keep it up.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.399
My lord.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.240
This subordinate will leave, will leave.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:19.360
How are you getting along with Ru Feng?

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.240
Quite well.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.279
Ru Feng is a promising, good kid.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.159
I have high hopes for him.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.480
Having high hopes means telling him

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:27.360
not to listen to me in everything.

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:30.039
I was just talking nonsense.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.840
Actually, Ru Feng is extremely loyal to you.

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.519
When I kept him by my side, I told him,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.080
the day he finds what he wants to do for himself,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600
he can leave at any time.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.600
What is this?

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.000
I suspect things won't be peaceful lately.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.399
This can be used for self-defense.

00:16:58.879 --> 00:16:59.799
Just activate the mechanism,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.039
and it will shoot needles that render people unconscious.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.200
Give me your hand.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:39.079
Thank you.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.359
This bracelet is very precious.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.640
I have no money, you know.

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:47.559
Who's asking you for money?

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:49.480
Then what do you want?

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:51.480
You'll find out later.

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:53.839
As long as it's not silver, it's fine.

00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:59.160
Come, I'll teach you how to activate the mechanism.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680
What are you doing here?

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.079
Couldn't sleep late at night, came to see you.

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:47.279
Why see me? I'm not a sleeping pill.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.839
Sleeping pill?

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.799
What is that?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.480
Something that aids sleep.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.200
Tell the truth.

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:56.720
Why did you come running to me?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.079
The stars are bright tonight, the moonlight is beautiful.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.480
Let's go see together.

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:11.240
Can't sleep in the middle of the night.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.000
Do you have something on your mind?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Need me to offer some guidance?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.359
The stars are bright.

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:30.079
The moonlight is beautiful.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.519
If not the scenery, looking at a person is fine too.

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:38.079
There are mosquitoes.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.799
Shao Jue, see how loyal my friend is?

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:44.519
Feeding mosquitoes late at night to listen to your troubles.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:45.920
What did you just say?

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:54.599
It's nothing, I don't need it.

00:19:59.519 --> 00:20:00.200
Thanks.

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:16.119
Why aren't you asleep yet?

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:19.119
Young Master Meng treats my villa

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:20.759
like his own back garden.

00:20:27.079 --> 00:20:28.240
The back garden of Meng Mansion

00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:32.440
is not as beautiful as here.

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:44.359
Shao Jue, it's getting late.

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:46.000
Perhaps you should head back first.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.240
Alright.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.240
Next time, I'll watch the stars with you again.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.720
Next time, I'll visit your residence again.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:07.960
No need to see me out.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.880
I'm going back to sleep now.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
There are quite a few mosquitoes here.

00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:22.160
You should rest early too.

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:22.759
Come here.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.920
What?

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.880
I'm heading back first.

00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:11.640
You've been bitten by a poisonous mosquito.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.880
Really?

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.920
Why would I lie?

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240
What should I do then?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.039
What are you doing?

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.680
Afraid you might faint.

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:39.799
The map left at Meng Mansion

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.799
must have been sent back to the palace by Yuwen Rui.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.559
We need to send someone to infiltrate the palace again to find the map.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.920
This matter requires careful planning.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.720
Yuwen Rui has had his eyes on you for a long time.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.960
Now he's also investigating my identity everywhere.

00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:54.960
If he discovers anything,

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.240
everything we've done will be in vain.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.160
Are we supposed to just wait idly like this?

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.160
Until Yuwen Rui uncovers your identity?

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.240
This Yuwen Rui

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:12.799
has always been our greatest threat.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.640
It would be better to

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:22.079
eliminate the threat for good.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.680
Xixi likes responsible and magnanimous men.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.720
Have you noted all this down?

00:23:37.119 --> 00:23:37.599
Princess,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.079
what kind of man do you like?

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:45.880
Someone like our lord here,

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.400
what do you think?

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.279
Your lord is quite good.

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:55.400
Unfortunately, he's not my destined one.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.440
Then tell me, who is your destined one?

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.359
There are so many.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.799
Like my Royal Sister, Xixi, Yinglu...

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:08.160
They are all my destined ones.

00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:12.839
Alright, enough joking.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.680
Regarding the map swap, the assassin wasn't caught.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.440
Did Father Emperor vent his anger on you?

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.519
Are you concerned about me?

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:21.559
Who's concerned about you?

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:27.960
His Majesty was naturally furious.

00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:30.799
He ordered me to capture the assassin within three days.

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.160
And you still have the mood to read leisurely here?

00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:53.559
My lord, a message from the Shadow Guard.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.799
What message?

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.480
Is it related to Prince Ning?

00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:03.359
Prince Ning petitioned His Majesty

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:06.839
to go to the three southeastern provinces to investigate the flood disaster.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.720
His Majesty consented. He has already left the city.

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:10.960
He left the city?

00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:13.519
He also took a group of death warriors from his residence.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.519
Investigating the flood is likely just a pretense.

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:19.319
He has another objective.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.640
I'm afraid he intends to take someone's life.

00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:26.559
Who does he want to kill?

00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:34.200
If he wants my life,

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.880
it won't be that easy.

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:39.759
Where did Ru Feng die?

00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:40.440
How did he die?

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:42.559
Right in the woods at the foot of this mountain.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.720
As for when he died,

00:25:45.839 --> 00:25:47.599
due to the increased mission difficulty,

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.559
you will not know when the cannon fodder perished.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.680
To leave this place,

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:56.839
must one pass through the woods below the mountain?

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.200
If Prince Ning wants to kill someone,

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.720
isn't the woods the best ambush point?

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:16.279
Yuwen Rui,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.440
be careful.

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:43.400
Ru Feng,

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:45.720
today you stay with me at the villa.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.279
You are not allowed to go anywhere, understand?

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:48.559
But...

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.960
All the Shadow Guards at the villa today

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.119
have gone down the mountain with Yuwen Rui.

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:54.240
Besides you, who else can guard me?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.000
Protect me?

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.599
Fifth Princess,

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.119
I...

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.000
If you have something to say, speak up. Why hesitate?

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.119
Didn't Xixi say before that after she leaves the palace,

00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:18.960
she wants to rent a shop

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.079
close to both Meng Mansion and the Yuwen residence?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.359
I recently found a courtyard I like.

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:25.880
I plan to take her to see it tomorrow.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.759
If she likes it, I'll give it to her.

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.480
I just don't know if you, Princess,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.039
would allow me to take her tomorrow.

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.279
Of course, it's fine.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.400
Not bad.

00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:39.160
You even know to buy a house.

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:40.839
If in the future,

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.079
Xixi can marry you,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.440
I'll give you a whole house full of dowry.

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:47.119
Thank you, Fifth Princess.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.200
No need for thanks.

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:50.359
We might be family in the future.

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:37.839
Today is your day of death.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:50.920
Attack!

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:30.880
It smells so good.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.279
Miss Xixi, I...

00:29:36.839 --> 00:29:37.480
What's wrong?

00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:41.119
Nothing.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.119
Ru Feng!

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.680
Xixi, hurry back to the villa.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.599
Stay with the Fifth Princess. I'll go check on my lord.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.480
But the Princess said you're not to leave.

00:30:16.359 --> 00:30:17.359
But I'm worried about my lord.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.759
Princess, Ru Feng went down the mountain.

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:28.839
What?

00:30:43.359 --> 00:30:44.079
Why are you here?

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.519
A severely injured death warrior was found outside the villa.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.559
I'm worried my lord is in danger.

00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:09.519
Ru Feng, watch out!

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:27.160
Fifth Princess, A Lan, are you alright?

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.000
We're fine.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.400
A Lan.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.400
Come here.

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:32.720
Come.

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:41.680
Don't take such risks in the future.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.759
Take Prince Ning back into custody.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.359
Yes.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:00.240
Prince Ning is indeed no match for Yuwen Rui.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.960
Proceed as planned.

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:05.160
You infiltrate the villa to rescue Prince Ning.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.559
If rescue is truly impossible,

00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:08.839
I understand.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.920
Be careful.

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:15.079
Does it hurt here?

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.000
What about here?

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:21.000
Bear with it.

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:26.839
How is it?

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.960
Much better.

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:44.079
My lord, Prince Ning has not yet awakened.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.680
I have confined him to the back courtyard.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.640
Fifth Princess, are you alright?

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720
It's all because of me...

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.119
It's fine, I'm better now.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:56.720
Look.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.599
Someone's there. I'll go check.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.559
Be careful.

00:33:10.599 --> 00:33:11.279
Stay alert.

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:11.960
Understood.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.440
Wake up.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.800
Guards! Someone, help!

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.880
Xixi.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:20.760
Ru Feng.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.320
This mission was truly perilous.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.079
Fortunately, it succeeded.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.320
You seem quite happy.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:44.360
Of course.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.199
However, more than the mission's success...

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.800
I'm happier that Ru Feng is alive.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.039
The mission is not yet complete.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.360
How is that possible? Wasn't Prince Ning...

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.519
Ru Feng!

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.320
Princess, run!

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.159
Go!

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:15.239
Ru Feng!

00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:17.519
Ru Feng! Ru Feng! Ru Feng!

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.599
Ru Feng! Ru Feng!

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.480
Ru Feng!

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.039
Ru Feng!

00:36:24.559 --> 00:36:25.119
Ru Feng!

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:25.960
Come.

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:34.559
Ru Feng... Ru Feng...

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.000
My lord, I...

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.119
It seems I can only accompany you this far.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.320
It's my fault. I failed to protect you.

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:54.199
My lord, if not for you...

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:58.119
I would have died in the war long ago.

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:01.280
To have stayed by your side...

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:03.719
I die without regret.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.199
Princess, this... please...

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.159
Help me give it to Xixi.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.840
No, no! You give it to her yourself.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.039
I won't.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.239
Don't say it's from me.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:38.599
Just say... it's a gift from the princess.

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:40.320
No, I beg you...

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.559
You give it to her yourself.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.519
You give it to her yourself.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.679
No...

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.039
My lord and Xixi...

00:37:51.159 --> 00:37:52.480
I entrust them to you, Princess.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.920
Ru Feng! Ru Feng, don't! Ru Feng!

00:37:56.639 --> 00:37:59.199
Ru Feng, you mustn't! Ru Feng!

00:38:00.519 --> 00:38:01.599
Ru Feng...

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.840
No! Ru Feng, no!

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:07.599
Ru Feng, don't...

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.639
Ru Feng... Ru Feng...

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.920
Ru Feng...

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.599
No!

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.199
Ru Feng...

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:41.800
Back then...

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.719
After my lord saved me from the sea of fire...

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.639
I practiced swordplay day and night.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.639
Actually...

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.800
It wasn't just to be able to stay by my lord's side.

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:49.800
More importantly...

00:39:50.519 --> 00:39:51.960
I wanted to become someone like my lord.

00:39:53.519 --> 00:39:55.360
In times of war, to ride forth with spear in hand...

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.719
To go into battle and slay the enemy.

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.599
To protect Yunmi's eternal peace.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:00.920
In times of peace...

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:03.360
To hold court in Luo Jing, deterring all quarters.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.480
So that other nations would never dare invade Yunmi.

00:40:10.519 --> 00:40:12.840
Didn't Xixi say before that after she leaves the palace...

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.679
She wants to rent a shop?

00:40:14.159 --> 00:40:15.760
One close to both the Meng Mansion and the Yuwen residence?

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:17.800
I recently found a courtyard I like.

00:40:18.159 --> 00:40:19.239
I plan to take her to see it tomorrow.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.800
If she likes it, I'll give it to her.

00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:22.920
I just don't know...

00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:25.840
If it would be convenient for you, Princess, to let me take her tomorrow.

00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:44.400
He was rescued from a sea of fire.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.039
He held the lofty ambition to slay enemies and serve his country.

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:56.639
He never got to take up his spear and go to the battlefield.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.960
He never got to marry the girl he loved.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.559
Prince Ning has not awakened.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.480
The imperial physician says...

00:41:41.719 --> 00:41:43.440
Perhaps he will never wake up.

00:41:44.239 --> 00:41:46.400
The mysterious man wanted to silence him.

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.360
I will continue investigating the mysterious man's identity.

00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:09.079
Xixi.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.599
Princess, what is this?

00:42:14.679 --> 00:42:15.360
This is...

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.679
It's the courtyard I asked Ru Feng to buy for me a while ago.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.800
Didn't you say you wanted to open a shop after leaving the palace?

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.119
This is for you.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.239
Thank you, Princess.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.000
I am very sorry.

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:05.079
This mission failed.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.320
If you fail again...

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.119
You will remain here forever.

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:13.800
Please accept my condolences.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.400
In the past, when I saved people...

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.199
It was to complete a mission.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360
It was to go home.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.800
But saving Ru Feng...

00:43:54.119 --> 00:43:56.199
If I were as skilled in martial arts as my royal sister...

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:01.920
Would Ru Feng still be alive?

00:44:07.159 --> 00:44:07.920
A Lan.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760
This is not your fault.

00:44:11.079 --> 00:44:12.679
It was Prince Ning and his men who killed Ru Feng.

00:44:13.239 --> 00:44:14.000
Believe me.

00:44:15.079 --> 00:44:16.239
I will avenge him.

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:23.679
Master, how is Prince Ning?

00:44:25.199 --> 00:44:26.079
The imperial physician examined him.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.599
He may never wake up.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.960
Without Prince Ning as a pawn...

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.960
We must act with even greater caution from now on.

00:44:33.519 --> 00:44:35.039
To avoid detection by Yuwen Rui.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.280
I understand.
