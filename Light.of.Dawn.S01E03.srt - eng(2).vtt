=Light of Dawn=

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.900
(Guess who you are.)

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.860
(Guess who you are.)

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.840
You must be Gao Feng.

00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:07.933
The police told me not to say it.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.910
I think you should know.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.755
Your dad didn't die of illness.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.520
Go on.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.960
Why did you come to me?

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.800
What do you know?

00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:21.111
What's your connection
to the one who tailed me?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.520
Nothing.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.000
I just felt Mr. Gao's death was unclear.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.750
I only learned his name
after the police came.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.240
I've felt awful ever since.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.750
That day, I wanted to find his family.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.560
That's it?

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.960
Your dad died. You're not sad at all?

00:03:48.844 --> 00:03:50.080
He was my foster father.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.870
Then take it as me meddling.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.590
Wait.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.910
I want to know
what really happened to him.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.750
Could you please tell me?

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.800
(The day the stone lion was smashed,)

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.590
(your dad was sitting right here.)

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:17.511
(He seemed to be waiting for someone,)

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.022
(but that person never came.)

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.720
(Later, he made several calls)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.070
(and got a bit anxious.)

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.240
(Waiting for who?)

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.310
I didn't hear clearly.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.800
It seemed to be a woman.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.480
Two days later, the police came.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.680
They asked what happened that day.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.310
That is when I knew

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.750
that Mr. Gao...

00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:43.190
The police told me not to tell anyone.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.920
But as a family,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.560
it should raise some concern.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.630
Don't overthink it.

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:53.000
It has nothing to do with you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.830
It does.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.630
If only I had asked one more thing.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.950
That day...

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.560
(Mr. Gao cried here.)

00:05:01.622 --> 00:05:03.600
(It was my first time
seeing an elderly man)

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.720
(cry so heartbrokenly.)

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.480
I read in a book

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.480
that habits don't lie.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.240
Even if it was an adoption,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.560
you two must be close.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.750
That day,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.630
when Mr. Gao sat here thinking alone...

00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:20.680
(He made the same gesture.)

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.830
(My name is Gao Feng.)

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.630
(An orphan.)

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.480
(Being an orphan isn't always an ending)

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.950
(or a full stop.)

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.390
(It can also be a question mark.)

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.510
(A search without knowing whom to find.)

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.750
(A longing without knowing for whom.)

00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:56.310
(It's the pain
felt in every family search case)

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.390
(feeling like it was your own.)

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.800
(It's projecting every tragedy)

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.600
(onto yourself with restless anger.)

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.560
(Before finding the answer,)

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.070
(I choose to be an orphan.)

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.020
=Episode 3=
=Charm=

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.480
Miss, we're here.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.430
Thanks.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.070
No problem.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.070
Bye.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.190
Hello. Where to?

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.720
How long
does your dash cam keep records?

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.333
Do you still have the footage

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.070
from the day
the old man passed last week?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.360
No, Feng, I didn't lie to you.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.830
I only drove Mr. Gao
to Songjiang Garden.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.120
I know.

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:46.333
I still need to check other drivers,

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.190
and see whose car he took
and where he went.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.155
Feng, are you
not making this hard for me?

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.060
I'll hire your car
for the whole day, alright?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.240
Feng, don't mess with me.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.480
Where would you get the money?

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.270
Feng, we're here.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.000
Nonsense.
Songjiang Garden isn't that close.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.800
Drive faster.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.510
Feng, we really are here.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.120
I told Dong to bring you here.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.270
The cemetery
is in the seventh row of section C.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.000
Come bow and offer incense
with me later.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.240
I don't care what you do outside,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.870
but the Gao family's rules stand.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.190
Sit down and eat.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.870
You're a busy man.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.720
I won't keep you long.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.480
He found my mom, right?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.310
Is this why

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.688
he made you swear to hide from me?

00:07:56.955 --> 00:07:58.720
I could feel it ever since I was young.

00:07:59.022 --> 00:08:01.430
The old man was afraid
I would look for my parents.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.270
I saw my adoption papers.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.430
The official seal was fake.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:06.870
Yes.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.160
I stopped looking for a while

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.622
and kept going out instead.

00:08:11.355 --> 00:08:12.950
Because while the old man was alive,

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:15.111
I was afraid
of hurting our relationship.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.950
But now that he's gone,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.510
why are you still hiding it from me?

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.630
Why are you and Su Min like this?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.840
Fine.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.120
If you don't want to talk,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.120
I won't push you.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.840
But don't stop me if I want to search.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.030
Get out.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.360
Get out.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.440
You don't deserve to eat our food.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.080
Expand checks to orthopedics and dental.

00:09:31.088 --> 00:09:33.200
(Outpatient Department)
We should find some leads.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.960
Let's split up.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.910
Follow me?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.320
No need.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.000
This family is messy enough.

00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:54.480
Go home and stay with your mom.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.510
What's going on, Sir?

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.120
Who is this?

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.750
Get in the car.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.790
Su Min.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.360
Can we talk?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.220
(Outpatient Department)

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.670
I also

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.790
don't know who else to ask.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.550
(He left the cafe at 9 AM sharp.)

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.600
(Binchuan Donghu Hospital)
(9:19 AM, he reached People's Hospital)

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.550
(and canceled
next month's chemotherapy.)

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.960
(Bank ATM)
(10:38 AM, he went to Agricultural Bank)

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.360
(and withdrew 300 yuan in cash.)

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.000
(The rest went to Zhang Jing's card.)

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.510
(11:20 AM,
he bought groceries at Wuyi Road.)

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.870
(He spent 270 yuan)

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.000
(on 2 kg
of premium Inner Mongolia beef.)

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.150
(12:50 AM,
he went to Old Town Farmers' Market.)

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.600
(He spent 22 yuan)

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.360
(and pulled strings
for a quarter bottle of paraquat.)

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.790
(Then, he went to Songjiang Garden.)

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.840
(Finally,
he returned to the old building.)

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.910
So during these time slots,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.790
this place,

00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:55.630
(Songjiang Garden)
and this one

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.000
are the key locations.

00:10:57.022 --> 00:10:59.288
One of the people Gao Dahua
met in these places

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.790
is probably my birth mother.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.030
Did you hear me?

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.840
I did.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.030
But about Mr. Gao...

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.320
In the eyes of the law,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.120
this isn't a criminal case.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.240
It's not my concern.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.790
That's the rule.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.910
Personally, I respect Mr. Gao's wishes.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.320
There are some things I can't tell you.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.510
That's personal.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.440
Fine.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:29.550
Su Min.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.600
You win.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.790
When I met Mr. Gao, I sat right there.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.200
I was eight that year.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.960
My biological parents and I
came to Binchuan.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.120
Not bad, kid.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.360
Eat more.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.030
Eat rice and grow taller.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.550
Spicy chicken's here.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.750
(I remember)

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.840
spicy chicken
was the only dish on the table.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.080
My dad was talking
when he bit some Sichuan pepper.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.630
Suddenly, two men with knives rushed in.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.000
Mom.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.480
What are you doing?

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.120
(I used to think
they worked in Guangzhou.)

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.870
(At the memorial,)

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.000
I learned they were narcotics police.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.120
They came to Binchuan
for my summer break.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.630
Mr. Gao told you this, right?

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:44.120
When he stopped you from police school.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.360
(I came secretly a few times
after they died.)

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.360
(I remember it was near closing time.)

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.480
Mr. Gao used leftover chicken soup

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.960
to make me a bowl of noodles.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.790
(It was the best noodles I've ever had.)

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.270
(Later, I transferred to Binchuan)

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.360
(just for that bowl of noodles.)

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.670
Now he's gone.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.630
I can't eat it anymore.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.750
Yes.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.910
We're both orphans.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.670
But at least you

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.480
remember your parents' faces,

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.150
remember what they said to you,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.030
and remember your last meal together.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.910
Me?

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.750
All I remember
are my mom's stupid songs.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:56.840
I don't even know

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.630
if she abandoned me

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.440
or if I was stolen.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.150
(As a kid, I searched nonstop.)

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.910
(Later, I wanted to be a policeman.)

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.000
(I want to enter police school.
Gao Dahua won't let me.)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.670
(I registered
on the family search site.)

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.910
I left my DNA there,
hoping that if something

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.150
happened someday,

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.080
it might be my relative.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.360
At least let me know

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.960
(where I'm from.)

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.080
Su Min.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.150
Us orphans

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.630
are like raindrops.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.550
We may end up falling

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.910
into the same muddy ground.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.510
But I just want to know

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.480
which cloud I fell from.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.320
Can I?

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.320
Sometimes, not knowing

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.270
gives you

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.440
more freedom

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.790
than knowing.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:06.870
Go home

00:15:07.888 --> 00:15:09.200
and keep your mom company.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.510
That's what you should do.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.150
I told her.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.630
Stay out of my business.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.910
And you.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.320
I'm gone.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.360
Gao Feng, why are you so persistent?

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.320
Let's swap then.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.630
I'll be the martyr's child,
and you get deceived by everyone.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.150
You!

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.670
Gao Feng, stand there.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.510
For the so-called truth

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.960
and a mother you've never met,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.270
are you really
willing to hurt those around you?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:45.790
Fine.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440
Then I'll tell you.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.720
Mr. Gao went to Songjiang Garden

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.480
for you.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.550
That day at Songjiang Garden,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.270
you were the person Gao Dahua saw,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.790
right?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.790
I've had you act as my spy

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.670
for half a year.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.200
This brat slipped away again.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.320
This time,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.440
when will he come back?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.350
Mr. Gao.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.110
Actually, Gao Feng and I

00:17:09.866 --> 00:17:11.866
really have nothing to do
with each other.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.720
Stir-fried pork

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.680
and braised beef.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.310
Same as always.

00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:21.480
If they're not spoiled
when he comes back,

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.480
I'll slip them into his takeout.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.590
They're for you.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.920
I'm leaving Binchuan for a while.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.790
Spend more time

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.920
with Gao Feng.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.440
Open a bar

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.960
and rent a place together.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.270
If it were back then,

00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:45.480
you should've been married already.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.440
I didn't mean to hide it from you,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.920
but Mr. Gao feared
you'd be hurt to know.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.680
So did I.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.550
Mr. Gao suddenly asked me out that day

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.480
and said those things.

00:18:07.288 --> 00:18:08.270
I can't believe myself.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.580
I should have been more careful.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.240
Fine.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.920
You all care for the old man,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.310
and I'm the only jerk, right?

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.160
Then please

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.720
stay out of this jerk's business.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.440
Okay?

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.510
Go check.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.480
You won't be at ease until it's done.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.350
You're always drifting outside.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.000
Some day, you might get eaten by a bear.

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:45.088
We now
have an employer-employee relationship.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.400
If you die outside, I pay.

00:18:50.622 --> 00:18:52.070
The car is at the usual spot.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.400
Fuel's on you.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.350
Be back on time for work.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.310
What's with the honking?

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.400
If you're in a hurry,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.350
install wings and fly over.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.270
Idiot.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.480
Sorry.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
We usually aren't like this.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.720
People in Binchuan
are quite well-mannered.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.880
I've lived in this city for many years.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.750
I'm also from Binchuan.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.750
I used to be from here.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.670
♪I give long roads
to the distant horizon♪

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.690
♪I give roses to love♪

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.740
♪What can I give you♪

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.170
♪My lover?♪

00:20:49.155 --> 00:20:51.000
(You're really
not going to call the police?)

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.550
(The police are already investigating.)

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.110
(More importantly,)

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.070
(the child wants to search on his own.)

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.790
He wants to know who he is.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.070
That's enough.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.830
♪What can I give you?♪

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.180
♪I keep asking♪

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.290
♪I keep searching♪

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.950
♪I keep thinking♪

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.400
Gao Feng.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.310
Are you blind?

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.830
Can't you see the closed sign
at the entrance?

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.720
Come upstairs for hotpot.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.960
How's the search going?

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.200
If things are good,
consider it a celebration for you.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.240
Whether you talk is up to you.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.750
Gao Dahua found my mom.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.310
The old man's belongings
were hidden by the old lady.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.310
(Except for this photo.)

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.880
(There was also the old man's phone.)

00:22:09.111 --> 00:22:11.066
(The password
is the birthday he set for me.)

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.590
(There's a number on the phone)

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.160
(he kept calling before he died.)

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.110
(How can you be sure
this is your real mom?)

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.200
This is the only thing

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.960
my biological mother left me.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.422
There's a coffee stain on the photo.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.110
The old man took it to a café.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.640
He was waiting for my mom.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.880
Gao Dahua kept searching for her

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.790
until his last breath,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.000
but he wouldn't let me see her.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.480
Do you know

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.310
why I kept traveling?

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.350
The old lady once took me to see

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:00.440
a new mother who had just given birth.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.400
I was curious, so I asked her

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.110
how she recognized her own child

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.590
among the row of incubators.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.070
She told me

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.030
it's not by sight.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
It's by smell.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.440
When a mother approaches her child,

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.920
she can smell her own child's

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.640
milky and sweet

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.240
scent of kinship.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.110
I've never smelled it in Binchuan

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.310
all these years.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.160
The closest I got

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.110
was in Tibet.

00:23:40.977 --> 00:23:42.600
I became obsessed with that scent.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.000
After that, I'd often traveled.

00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:46.720
Now she's right in front of you.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.680
Why not find her?

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.350
If it's really like you guessed,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.790
then the phone

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.750
should have your mom's call records.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.000
You're scared.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.790
If she's in Binchuan,

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.310
I don't know why she won't come see me.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.350
She even sent me a birthday cake, but...

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.480
Gao Feng.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.310
Your conflict

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.550
makes me envious.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.440
I can still clearly remember

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.000
the day I left home.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.440
My parents were playing
with my younger brother,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.750
their backs to me.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.110
They talk to me like talking to a dog.

00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:45.830
They said that even if I want to leave,

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.030
I have to empty my pockets first.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.440
I didn't even get a chance to hesitate.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.750
Ten years have passed.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.920
I was really lost back then.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.510
I didn't understand
why they didn't even hesitate

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.550
for a moment.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.640
Maybe your mom is avoiding you

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.880
because she feels guilty

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.440
and scared.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.440
But Gao Feng,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.000
every day after this,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.070
I'm endlessly grateful.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.070
I'm grateful
that I got through that stage.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.070
Now it's your turn.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.240
Charge through it,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.030
and maybe it's dawn.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.720
Don't be afraid.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.030
Mom?

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.160
I'm not.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.830
Then who are you?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.200
You're about to find her.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.920
The sound of a train...

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.680
Hey, I'm already at the station.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.590
Who's this?

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.200
Why are you messing with my mom?

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.920
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Insane? Where's security?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.790
Sorry.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.310
Hello?

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.680
Something happened.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.550
What do you want?

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.480
I'm here for Su Min.

00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:53.622
Why did the old man
never let me find my mother,

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.240
even until his death?

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.750
Is my mom really that scary to you?

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.590
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.790
The old man saw her before he died,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.590
right?

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.110
She's who you're looking for
today, too, right?

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.070
You prepared all that money

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.510
to silence her, didn't you?

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.790
After my IV drip,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.240
I'll tell you everything.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.070
I'm tired.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.160
This is from when you were a baby.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.240
It was with you and your round ball.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.110
After the old man found out he was sick,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.110
he knew his days were numbered.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.720
He insisted on searching for you.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.400
I thought he was crazy,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.350
so I cut off the home internet.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.160
(He went out,)

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.550
(secretly continuing to search
at internet cafés.)

00:29:04.155 --> 00:29:06.777
(Missing Person Notice Editing)
(What's wrong with my origin?)

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.110
He feared you couldn't handle it.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.920
Most orphans are unwanted.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.790
If the results were bad,

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.550
he wouldn't tell you.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.200
No.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.070
She came to find me.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.830
If it were real,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.400
the old man wouldn't have died.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.270
It's fake.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.110
A scam.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.920
(We've been scammed many times.)

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.920
(This time, they wanted
the most money. 100,000 yuan.)

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.680
(All his chemotherapy money)

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.240
plus one of my fixed deposits.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.750
Gao Feng.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.750
I know you.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.070
I know your temper.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.720
You'll definitely dig to the bottom.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.400
So after the old man passed,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.550
I kept calling the scammer.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.030
I kept calling.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.240
I don't want the money.

00:30:09.244 --> 00:30:10.888
I don't need her to pay with her life.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.480
I just want to find her

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.480
so that she can tell you
how the old man died.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160
Until yesterday,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.440
she called me back.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.720
She arranged a place to meet,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.200
saying she wanted to talk privately.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.680
(This is the money your man gave me.)

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.310
(I haven't touched a cent.)

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.590
Go tell the police.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.400
Don't leave!

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.510
(I reclaimed a bit of money.)

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.400
Now count it
and see how much short we are.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.160
Let the police investigate the rest.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.110
This money is yours.

00:30:52.688 --> 00:30:54.790
Consider it the last bit
of our wealth for you.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.310
I've said everything.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.920
Whether you believe it

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.590
is up to you.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.000
If this is the case,

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.200
why did you keep it
from me all this time?

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240
I've also wondered

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.160
about this.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.440
Why make me swear an oath?

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.720
Why insist I keep it from you?

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.550
When it blew up yesterday,

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.110
I suddenly understood.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.830
Back then, I thought

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.720
if I died there,

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.160
I still wouldn't let you know.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.200
If you knew

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.400
we'd both have lost our lives for you,

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.830
how would you
live the rest of your life?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.160
You're more sensitive than other kids.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.920
You'd blame yourself.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.510
You're just like the old man.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.030
Both cooked ducks,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.720
but still stubborn.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.270
You'll say
it's not for the other's good,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.160
but you still care for them.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.310
This phone.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.440
You've been calling that scammer,

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.960
but you haven't looked inside.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.200
There's a video
the old man left for you.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.590
Find it.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.240
(Son.)

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.110
(I'll teach you)

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.400
(your favorite braised pork today.)

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.133
(If you don't get it the first time,)

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.000
(replay it a few times.)

00:32:28.177 --> 00:32:30.110
(Watch it over and over,
and you'll get it.)

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.200
(And this pork.)

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.920
(Get it from the stall at Wuyi Market.)

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.720
(Theirs is good.)

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.790
(Let's start.)

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.200
(Watch the steps closely.)

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.110
(Give it a quick toss.)

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.310
(The aroma's out. Do you smell it?)

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.310
(Gao Feng.)

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.200
(I...)

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.350
(really want to be a good father.)

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.510
(I have no time.)

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720
(I have no time left.)

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.200
(Both of us)

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.590
(have been awkward all our lives.)

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.110
(In the end,)

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.070
(we're still awkward.)

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720
(If there were...)

00:33:17.866 --> 00:33:19.466
(If there were another lifetime...)

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.790
(If there were another lifetime,)

00:33:24.444 --> 00:33:25.622
(we should both change.)

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.590
(From now on,)

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.750
(stop traveling.)

00:33:31.933 --> 00:33:33.666
(Come home
and spend time with your mom.)

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.440
(Her whole life)

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960
(hasn't been easy.)

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.590
I followed the recipe.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.750
The color's still off.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.550
Try it.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.350
(Son, I'll teach you)

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.830
(your favorite braised pork today.)

00:34:05.844 --> 00:34:07.590
(If you don't get it the first time,)

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.510
(replay it a few times.)

00:34:09.555 --> 00:34:10.590
(Watch it over and over,)

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.510
(and you'll get it.)

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.320
We were wrong.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.960
All these years,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.030
we shouldn't have
hidden things from you.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.030
Once we talk it out, it's fine.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.630
The old man said

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.840
we should look further.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.710
Life's road widens as you walk.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.440
(It shouldn't narrow.)

00:34:43.022 --> 00:34:44.510
(When you get tired of traveling,)

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.320
(remember you have a home
in Binchuan.)

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.000
(The bed here is always made for you.)

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.920
(The quilt's always aired, too.)

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.280
(Salty taste of pork and tears.)

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.760
(Sun-dried detergent on clothes.)

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.400
(Mothballs and wood dust.)

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.880
(Mixed together,)

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.190
(they're the smell of home)

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.800
(that belongs to me.)

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.070
Who is it?

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.150
Why so early?

00:35:48.288 --> 00:35:49.866
Where's your birth mother's photo?

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.710
I gave up and stopped looking.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.440
Where is it?

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.840
Gao Feng.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.800
(People's Police)
Case 1009 Task Force of Binchuan Police

00:36:01.822 --> 00:36:02.880
hereby notifies you

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.550
in accordance with the law.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.550
We may need your cooperation.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.590
Based on your records
on family-search websites

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.550
and your bone marrow donation,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.030
we ran a comparison.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.800
The remains
under Penglai Plaza's stone lion

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.230
are identified.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.800
They belong to your biological mother.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.550
Madam, please take a look.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.630
Is this the person you saw?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.960
I didn't touch a cent
of your husband's money.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.510
Take it all back.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.710
Whether it's a scam

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.110
or not,

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.400
explain it to the police.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.920
Don't drag my son into this.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.190
Let me advise you.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.070
Drop it.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.360
You can't stop it.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:54.320
What involves your son is serious.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.630
I don't want to hear it.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.360
Explain it to the police.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.320
What are you doing?

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:02.760
You can't leave.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.550
Explain it to the police.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.480
(She wore a hat and a mask.)

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.710
I couldn't see clearly.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.710
Please look at the CCTV footage.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.710
Does this person's outfit match hers?

00:37:18.711 --> 00:37:19.800
Madam, here's the thing.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.760
The situation is complicated.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.190
We suspect the person who scammed

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.800
your husband Gao Dahua isn't ordinary.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.110
It looks a bit like her.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.590
I just can't remember clearly.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.320
A bit? In what way?

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.030
I really can't recall clearly.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.760
Please try to remember carefully.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.110
This is really important.
Please carefully...

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.030
That's enough.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.110
She's just an ordinary old lady.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.400
Facing such a big matter,

00:37:43.622 --> 00:37:45.320
forgetting for a moment is normal.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.000
She's not a suspect.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.840
I may have seen

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.000
this person before.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.880
It's her.

00:38:56.866 --> 00:38:58.150
We used to eat this often.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.000
Try some.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.920
Son, thank you

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:08.422
for what happened with the police.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.800
Your nose is really good.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.110
You're just a bit different
from your dad now.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.840
Just add a bit more chili.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:28.880
Here.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.670
I thought

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.880
you had no feelings for us.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.480
It's good.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.070
It seems

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.000
you still care about us.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.550
Do you and the old man

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.400
know how my biological mother died?

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.320
My mom was buried in that statue.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.355
The old man went to Penglai Plaza
before he died.

00:40:12.377 --> 00:40:13.800
It's all too coincidental.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.760
When he brought you back,

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.110
your dad handled the paperwork.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.230
I don't know the rest.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.070
What about the rest? The middleman?

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.710
No.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.230
Mom.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.230
I don't know.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.190
Your dad never tells me anything.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.110
All my life,
I accept things as they are.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.480
Don't you know my character?

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.840
Fine, forget I asked.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.030
Let's eat.

00:40:40.755 --> 00:40:41.760
We've talked this far.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.400
If not opened up, can you eat?

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:43.960
I trust you.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.150
Do you trust your dad?

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.030
Do you or not?

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.440
Stop talking.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.400
I'll speak for you.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.400
You suspect your dad.

00:40:53.422 --> 00:40:55.670
You suspect he's related
to your biological mother's death.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:56.150
Right?

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.590
You suspect us.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.030
We're all bad people, right?

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.710
Mom, let's eat.

00:41:02.622 --> 00:41:03.911
What do you want to know?

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.440
I'll show you everything.

00:41:05.688 --> 00:41:06.840
My marriage certificate,

00:41:06.888 --> 00:41:08.070
your adoption certificate,

00:41:08.111 --> 00:41:09.444
and my retirement certificate.

00:41:09.444 --> 00:41:10.510
I'll find them all for you.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.630
Also, before I worked,

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:14.150
I had two political review reports.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.230
No need.

00:41:15.244 --> 00:41:16.510
Your dad also has a phone book.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.480
It lists all his drinking friends

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480
and card buddies.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.670
Call them one by one.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.480
Ask around.

00:41:21.488 --> 00:41:22.960
See what kind of person your dad is.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.110
Where are you hurt?

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.466
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.280
Don't touch me!

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.400
How did this happen?

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.440
Son.

00:41:50.177 --> 00:41:52.070
Your biological mother's death
is a homicide.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:54.230
A homicide, understand?

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.190
Homicides are complicated.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.000
Let the police investigate.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.230
Come home, okay?

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.360
Son, come home.

00:42:01.111 --> 00:42:02.320
Once I finish investigating,

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.590
I'll come home.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.110
(Inside the stone lion
at Penglai Plaza.)

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.280
(9th October 2018.)

00:42:26.666 --> 00:42:27.960
(Unidentified female corpse.)

00:42:33.622 --> 00:42:35.400
(I've been searching
for my real birthday.)

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.550
(I want to know who I am.)

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.880
(I've considered countless answers.)

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.030
(Countless scenarios
of meeting my mother.)

00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:45.444
(In the snowy mountains of Sichuan.)

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:47.440
(In the plains of Shaanxi.)

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.550
(By the sea in Gulangyu.)

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.110
(I never imagined this kind of answer.)

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.190
It's been over 20 years.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.360
Are you cold?

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.670
(I'm about to find out who I am.)

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.150
(I found my biological mother.)

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:23.280
(Or rather, she found me.)
