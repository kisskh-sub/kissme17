00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 26=

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.359
Are you really leaving
all these treasures to me?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.599
We agreed that once every item

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.599
in the Treasure Trove

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.760
was recovered,

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.159
Yashe would close.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.280
These artifacts

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.760
never should've existed
in other timelines to begin with.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.719
So apart from Tianguang Market,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.280
I can't think of a more fitting place.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.599
You said it yourself.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:12.520
Don't go back on it.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.199
When have I ever

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.960
taken back a gift I gave you?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.240
Oh, right.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.719
I've found some leads
about the Dushan Jade,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.919
but nothing definitive.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.599
Really?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.120
The Dushan Jade is strange indeed.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.400
Ever since it appeared
in Young Master Qin's possession,

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.644
there's been no record of it
circulating again.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.520
I came across it once

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.479
in Huayang in 2005.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.120
Exactly.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.560
That's the odd part.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.120
If there was an auction record,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.719
it means it was moving through time.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.439
But there was only that one instance.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.000
Nothing before, nothing after.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.639
It's as if

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.319
it briefly flashed
into existence in 2005.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.960
Could someone have hidden it?

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.639
And now the Dushan Jade

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.159
has somehow appeared in my era.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.199
What?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.800
I guess it was hiding in plain sight.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.919
The Dushan Jade

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.199
is currently at an auction house
called Fusheng Hall.

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:22.190
I'm planning to look into it.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.080
If it's an auction house...

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.000
Then let it be auctioned again.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.759
If the Dushan Jade
has surfaced in my time,

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.560
and all the artifacts
have been reclaimed,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.800
perhaps I won't return...

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.319
to Tianguang Market.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.199
(Luoxia Manor)

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.000
Market Lord.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.039
Am I one of the few visitors

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.919
who actually gets
to keep these memories?

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.199
Probably.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.759
You're my greatest benefactor.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.800
Yet, I still don't know your name.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.000
Why do you want to know that?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.759
I forgot it a long time ago.

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:24.120
You, on the other hand,

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:25.720
mustn't forget me.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.959
You've built up lifetimes
of good karma just to meet me.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.199
I not only gave you a chance

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.140
to make amends for the damage
you caused to the timelines,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.120
but I even gave you
pinpoint-accurate locations.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.360
Without my help,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.680
you'd still be searching

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.120
when you're an old man.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.480
(I can apply to the Time Administration)

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.600
(to let you continue
investigating the Dushan Jade.)

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.519
(After all, it's connected
to Young Master Qin as well.)

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.160
(Thank you, Market Lord.)

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.920
Chu Qiu,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.319
thank you for everything.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:00.680
No need to thank me.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.279
It's my duty.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.040
Still, thank you

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:08.160
for being lenient about my mistakes.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:12.488
That was partly out of respect
for the Market Lord.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.519
Besides, what you did

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.279
didn't disrupt the order of time.

00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:19.160
Once you finish
investigating the Dushan Jade,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.279
return Yashe as soon as possible.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.319
I will.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.800
You're really leaving.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.360
Once you're gone,
no one will bring me gifts anymore.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.040
That poker face hasn't the faintest clue

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.920
what I like.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.519
This is the last gift I'm giving you.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.040
What is it?

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.000
I only see a silver chain.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.439
Where's the pendant?

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.240
I've given you many gifts,

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.439
yet you never replaced
that longevity lock.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.040
I figured it must be important to you.

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:04.839
The red string's gotten old.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:07.439
So I found you a new silver chain.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.279
May it keep you safe in my place.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.279
I know everyone

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.879
at Tianguang Market

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.600
has their own story.

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.639
I hope

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.839
you never forget yours.

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:24.519
And never forget your name.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.000
Farewell.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.639
Take care.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.519
Search Fusheng Hall.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.740
(Fusheng Hall trades silk-bound
manuscript fragments for resources)

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.660
(Scholars at Fusheng Hall identify them
as relics of the digital age)

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.660
(Fusheng Hall laboratory announces
the successful removal of time dust)

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.660
(Fusheng Hall launches cultural artifact
neural resonance chips)

00:07:47.444 --> 00:07:49.270
Book the earliest appointment available.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.920
(Name: Bizhi, Location: West Sector 19)

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.160
Appointment confirmed.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:14.319
The Fusheng Hall certainly
has deep pockets.

00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:15.560
There's an understated grace.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.800
(Yun, Fusheng Hall Liaison)
Mr. Bizhi, please have a seat.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.439
Thank you.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.319
I'm here regarding the Dushan Jade.

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:25.844
The Dushan Jade mountain carving
titled "Visiting a Friend".

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:27.959
As far as I know,

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.759
we don't have any
Dushan Jade pieces in our collection.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.629
We did recently receive

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.488
a Hetian jade mountain sculpture,
though.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.120
Would you be interested?

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.399
It's not listed
in your internal collection

00:08:40.822 --> 00:08:41.790
either?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.879
I received information about it.

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:50.600
I stand corrected.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:53.039
We do have a Dushan Jade Ruyi
in our collection.

00:08:54.777 --> 00:08:56.550
But it's not the piece
you're referring to.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:05.120
(The email clearly showed
the Dushan Jade.)

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.679
(But Fusheng Hall claims
they don't have it.)

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:09.120
(How odd.)

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.320
(Any ancient artifact that still exists)

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.120
(whether passed down through generations
or traded many times)

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:17.639
(should leave traces in time.)

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.960
(Yet only Ziyi's Dushan Jade)

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:22.799
(has such an unusual
time-space footprint.)

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:26.080
This Dushan Jade mountain sculpture

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.519
is a family heirloom.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.240
It's the sole token of my clan.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.080
To see this jade

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.600
is to see me.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.240
It truly is a rare masterpiece.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:40.440
But we've only just met.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:42.960
You trust me enough to bring me here?

00:09:42.977 --> 00:09:44.730
If you ask me,
I feel like we should've met

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.840
much earlier.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.840
And since

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.960
the theme of this jade mountain piece

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.088
is visiting a friend,

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.919
it's only right that I show it to you.

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.360
Security here is tight now.

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:57.759
Do you have a way
to take the Dushan Jade out?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.960
Rest assured.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.440
I'm sorry I failed your trust...

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.200
The Dushan Jade

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.399
was stolen by thieves.

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:09.840
(From that moment on,)

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.919
(the Dushan Jade vanished
from all records.)

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.720
(When it resurfaced again,)

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.960
(it was at a private
Huayang auction in 2005.)

00:10:17.288 --> 00:10:18.911
(The Dushan Jade was stolen once more)

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.120
(right from the auction house)

00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:22.910
(before I could get my hands on it.)

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.910
Run an advanced search.

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:42.080
Advanced search complete.

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:45.222
No results for Dushan Jade across
the entire current time-space network.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.840
(The Dushan Jade was stolen
after the auction)

00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:50.150
(and disappeared without a trace.)

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:52.559
(Now it's shown up at Fusheng Hall.)

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:54.519
(Is there)

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.600
(some kind of link between the two?)

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.840
(This won't do.)

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:04.279
(I should start with Fusheng Hall.)

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:07.240
Current timeline...

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:09.919
Cross-timeline...

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.279
Connect to other time-space networks?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.039
Yes.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.377
(System Prompt: Connection Established)

00:11:20.088 --> 00:11:21.550
(Fusheng Hall Official Site)

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:23.840
(The entrance was hidden
in another timeline?)

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.639
Welcome to Fusheng Hall.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.399
Would you like to view
the undisclosed exhibits?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.919
Yes.

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.600
Due to the high value of these exhibits,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.679
your account balance must be verified.

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.159
Authorize?

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:36.279
Yes.

00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:40.839
Congratulations.
Your application has been approved.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.029
We'll be in touch.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.130
(Fusheng Hall,
your application has been approved.)

00:11:44.133 --> 00:11:45.020
(We'll be in touch.)

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:00.600
Sir.

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:04.290
(Hall Master, Fusheng Hall)
Have the clients

00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:06.159
for the autumn auction been finalized?

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:07.159
They have.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.840
Here's the list.

00:12:11.977 --> 00:12:13.550
This is fewer than I expected.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.639
Quality over quantity.

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:16.840
I've vetted them.

00:12:16.888 --> 00:12:18.288
Everyone on this list is a buyer

00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:20.510
worthy of those treasures.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.279
Fusheng Hall

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.559
went to great lengths

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:29.679
to collect these rare pieces.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.279
They should end up

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:33.120
with buyers worthy of them.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.080
That's why

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.679
even our auction participants

00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:38.480
must be chosen with great care.

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:41.720
With the same care
as matching orphans with families.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.159
Ye Liangyin,

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:46.799
this isn't your first day
at Fusheng Hall.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.720
Even if you have your criteria,

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:53.320
do you understand who the people

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.039
behind those names are?

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:01.039
Do you remember our mission?

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:03.799
We collect artifacts across timelines

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.799
to keep them from being erased by time.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.279
A fleeting life

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:09.840
can be eternal.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.159
But we're not a charity!

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.159
So put your sentimentality away.

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:16.720
Understood.

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:18.279
Also,

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:21.200
the Four Seasons Scroll
is missing two paintings.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.159
Find them as soon as possible.

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.320
I don't tolerate imperfections.

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:57.559
Kill me.

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:09.360
(Neither do I.)

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.320
Sorry to keep you waiting,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.240
Mr. Bizhi.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.159
You booked this visit
to view our undisclosed exhibits.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.840
We know your time is valuable.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.879
The collection is ready
for your perusal.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.240
These are all exceptionally rare pieces.

00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:58.240
And they're displayed at full scale.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.679
If any of them interests you,

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:01.919
just let me know.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:16.399
(Dushan Jade Mountain Sculpture)

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.840
I was told you didn't have

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.639
the Dushan Jade Mountain Sculpture
in your collection.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.759
That was before

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:23.799
you became
one of our distinguished VIP clients.

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:25.039
May I schedule

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:27.159
a viewing of the actual piece?

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:27.879
One moment.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.669
I'm sorry.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.844
Your current status doesn't qualify you
to view this exhibit in person.

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:38.639
What's your policy?

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.720
I'm terribly sorry.

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:41.080
That's simply our policy.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.679
You may choose another exhibit.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.320
(The Coiled Dragon
Bronze Tripod Cauldron?)

00:15:58.577 --> 00:16:00.750
(It was part of Elder Yu's collection
at Rain Manor.)

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.799
What about this one?

00:16:07.177 --> 00:16:09.080
The Coiled Dragon
Bronze Tripod Cauldron.

00:16:09.222 --> 00:16:10.390
This piece is available.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:12.279
We can arrange
an in-person viewing for you.

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:13.320
Thank you.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.440
As soon as possible, please.

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.000
Let me register that for you.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.919
We'll notify you
of the time and location.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.639
All right.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.200
(Even the artifact
from Elder Yu's Rain Manor)

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:30.159
(has shown up
in Fusheng Hall's collection.)

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.519
(That can't be a coincidence.)

00:17:20.155 --> 00:17:21.240
I'm about to go on stage,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.377
but my necklace is missing!

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.240
Don't panic.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.300
I'll help you look for it.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.240
Wear hers for now.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.960
This way, please.

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:37.200
Mr. Bi, this way.

00:17:38.177 --> 00:17:39.640
Everyone else, please step outside.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.680
Hurry up!

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.319
The flowers are lovely.

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:01.920
Thank you.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.359
I'm glad they're to your liking.

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:07.240
Have a seat over there.

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:08.359
All right.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.044
It's been a while
since you came to my performances.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.844
I've been traveling a lot
for work lately.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.119
The moment I passed by,

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:16.559
I came straight to see you.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.000
Please, sit.

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:21.799
It's been over a year

00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:23.440
since we met at Rain Manor.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:23.960
It has.

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:27.240
Go ahead.

00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:29.960
I doubt you're actually here
to watch me perform.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.039
How can I help you?

00:18:31.688 --> 00:18:32.680
To be frank with you,

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.480
I wanted to ask about Elder Yu.

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:38.039
Did...

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.599
Did you not know?

00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:41.777
What happened?

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.160
Elder Yu passed away.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.920
When?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.533
Last summer, an earthquake happened.

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.039
There was a landslide near Rain Manor.

00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:58.680
Elder Yu was trapped beneath the gallery

00:18:59.079 --> 00:18:59.920
and didn't make it.

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:04.480
Everyone in the city knows about it.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:10.079
I've been busy out of town.

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:12.039
I didn't keep up with local news.

00:19:17.244 --> 00:19:19.550
You can see how things are
now that Elder Yu's gone.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:20.279
I...

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.720
So I really appreciate

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.079
you coming to see me.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.559
No need to thank me.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.960
You're as stunning as ever.

00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:35.160
What about the others at Rain Manor?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.400
His grandson?

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:39.200
I remember the two of them
depended on each other.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.880
You mean Chongyang?

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:42.279
He's fine.

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.079
Master Pan took him in.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.920
He even organized a group

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.880
to recover the antiques
Elder Yu collected from Rain Manor.

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:50.880
That was a huge undertaking.

00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:53.200
Were Elder Yu's antiques badly damaged?

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.720
I don't know the details.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.640
I just heard a lot of them were crushed.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:02.559
Restoring them would require
a lot of time and money.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.160
It'll cost a fortune.

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:07.799
After all,
the two of them shared a long history.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.480
Master Pan.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.400
It's good to see you.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:18.830
Come.

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:19.799
Sit.

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:20.359
All right.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.279
What's all this?

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:29.200
You must be here

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:31.000
to see Chongyang.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.119
Yes.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.480
Thank you for taking him in.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.079
As Elder Yu's old friend,

00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:37.720
may I see Chongyang?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.480
You're too late.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:41.680
If you'd come a few months earlier,

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:43.960
you might've.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240
What happened to him?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.359
It's a long story.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:53.799
After the earthquake,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.400
Chongyang was badly shaken.

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:59.519
He kept saying the place was haunted.

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.240
Nothing could calm him down.

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.519
Not long after he came here,

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:06.200
he fell seriously ill.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.119
I brought in the best physicians
in the city,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.160
and even doctors trained overseas.

00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:14.640
None of them could cure him.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.599
A few months ago,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.720
he didn't make it.

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:25.319
He died from the illness?

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.559
I won't hide it from you.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.359
My own son's a disappointment.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.160
Chongyang was smart and well-behaved.

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:37.319
I wanted to take him as my grandson.

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:39.079
I never expected...

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:43.119
That child had a hard fate.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.440
Master Pan, my condolences.

00:21:50.355 --> 00:21:51.310
When I arrived earlier,

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:54.200
I saw you restoring
Elder Yu's collection from Rain Manor.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.640
Rain Manor was Yu's life's work.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.680
I planned to finish restoring the pieces
and hand them over to Chongyang,

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:02.640
so no one would think I coveted them.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.559
But now,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.519
all I can do is what I can.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.359
May I take a look

00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:13.039
at the collection?

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.960
Of course.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.440
Please.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.240
Follow me.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:21.839
This way.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.400
Please.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.160
All right.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.070
All of them are here.

00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:28.600
- Master Pan.
- Master Pan.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.799
Take a break, all of you.

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:37.000
(These aren't fakes.)

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:39.079
(Pan Jingting doesn't seem to be lying.)

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:41.358
What about Elder Yu's favorite piece,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.155
the Coiled Dragon Bronze
Tripod Cauldron?

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.440
Was it damaged too?

00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:46.039
I know that piece.

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:48.279
But it's not here.

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:49.799
I'm sorry.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.039
Have you seen it?

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.240
The cauldron

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.440
wouldn't shatter even in an earthquake.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.039
But no,

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.119
we haven't seen it.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.119
You should get some rest, too.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:02.440
Perhaps Elder Yu gave it to someone?

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.119
From what I knew of Yu,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.079
those treasures were his life.

00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:09.240
He'd never give them away.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Was anyone else hurt

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:12.920
that day?

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.400
No.

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.519
All the servants were fine.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.079
That day,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.000
Yu just happened to be in the gallery
that was damaged the worst.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.622
(There's something off
about Elder Yu's death.)

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:27.920
(And Chongyang, too.)

00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:30.599
(Did Fusheng Hall silence him as well?)

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.960
(I need to see Chongyang again.)

00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:37.079
When did Chongyang pass away?

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:39.244
At the beginning of the month,
three months back.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.180
(Three Months Earlier)

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.559
What are you doing here?

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:07.960
What a pretty lantern.

00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:10.680
You remember me.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.640
I remember you.

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:14.079
On the Double Ninth Festival,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.000
you played Liubo Chess with my grandpa.

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:21.720
Grandpa's gone.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.519
Chongyang,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.519
try to remember

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.920
what your grandpa did
on the day of the earthquake.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.640
There was an earthquake.

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:40.319
Everyone went to the front hall.

00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:44.759
Only Grandpa went to the gallery.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:47.880
I was worried, so I followed him.

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:51.039
(When I found him,)

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:54.000
(he was lying alone in the gallery.)

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.240
Grandpa?

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:58.640
(The building hadn't collapsed yet.)

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:01.559
Grandpa!

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.519
The gallery's haunted.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680
Haunted?

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.880
(Then, the quake got worse.)

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.759
(I was so scared.)

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.920
(I ran to get help.)

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:27.599
(But it was too late.)

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.960
Why did you say it was haunted?

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:36.640
A lot of strange things happened
around that time.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.440
Sometimes at night,
I saw shadows near the gallery.

00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:44.880
I told Grandpa the gallery was haunted.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.359
He didn't believe me.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.759
And Miss Ning.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.880
She isn't Miss Ning.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.799
Who?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.240
She's not the same Miss Ning

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.160
who came later.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.359
What do you mean?

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.279
I saw the previous Miss Ning here.

00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:10.960
But she vanished soon after.

00:26:18.319 --> 00:26:19.680
Is Master Pan good to you?

00:26:21.319 --> 00:26:23.960
He told me that since Grandpa's gone,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.640
he'll be my grandpa now.

00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:31.799
If I die,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.680
will I see Grandpa again?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.920
Your grandpa will watch over you.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.559
Go to sleep now.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.319
Don't tell them I came.

00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:23.030
A genuine treasure is truly astonishing

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.599
when you see it yourself.

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:28.200
Of course.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.200
Fusheng Hall never deals in fakes.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.640
I believe that.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.240
If you're interested,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.119
you're welcome
to join our autumn auction.

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.720
I'm sure you'll gain something.

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:37.599
Of course.

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:39.720
How do I register?

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.680
We'll need to temporarily freeze
your personal assets.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:43.640
Is that acceptable?

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.359
One moment.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.880
This client has never conducted
any transactions with Fusheng Hall.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.559
Background check failed.

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:12.000
(Alert)
VIP membership revoked.

00:28:12.822 --> 00:28:14.070
What is the meaning of this?

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:15.240
We've determined

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.200
you don't meet the criteria
for our auction.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.799
I'm sorry,

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.079
but you're no longer
a client of Fusheng Hall.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.599
Wait.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.480
What if I have items to sell?

00:28:37.155 --> 00:28:38.880
I have the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:43.200
Gu Zhiqian's Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:45.680
(The Summer Cooling Painting.)

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.790
(The Winter Chill Painting.)

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.640
(They actually hold two pieces
from Gu Zhiqian's Four Seasons Scroll.)

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:04.000
Miss Ye.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.266
(Li, Fusheng Hall Operations Unit)
We've located Spring Stream Painting.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.620
(Ninghai City, Haidong Province)

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.359
It's been in the 21st century all along.

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:22.200
Good morning.

00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:23.590
Good morning, Master Dong.

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:24.200
Good morning.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.559
What's up?

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.920
Walking your pigeon again?

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.640
Yes.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.119
It's put on weight.

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:31.000
It's gotten plump.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.680
Isn't it?

00:29:32.044 --> 00:29:32.720
How are you?

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.559
Can you talk yet?

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:34.960
Hi. Hello.

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:37.519
Keep your hands to yourself.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.599
What is this thing?

00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:43.319
Put it there.

00:29:44.759 --> 00:29:45.559
Oil paintings.

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:46.839
New neighbor?

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.644
Oil paintings
at an antique and flea market?

00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:49.750
Are you sure they'll sell?

00:29:49.759 --> 00:29:51.200
Who are you to judge?

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:52.839
Ma'am?

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.000
Sir?

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.400
Is this your stall?

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.799
I just rented it.

00:29:58.119 --> 00:29:58.720
Wait...

00:29:59.079 --> 00:30:00.440
Why are you everywhere?

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:02.039
Why are you everywhere?

00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:05.640
You dumped your stuff at my place.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.920
Take it back now.

00:30:07.079 --> 00:30:08.079
This street stand yours?

00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:09.644
What do you mean by street stand?

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.680
This is an open-air tea house.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.599
Got it?

00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:13.240
Fine.

00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:14.680
You're older.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.640
I'll give you that.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.200
After all,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.319
you don't even have
a roof over your head.

00:30:18.319 --> 00:30:19.480
Out here in the wind and rain,

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.279
that's rough.

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:25.880
Move aside.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.244
(Ye Liangyin)
(Do you have time lately?)

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:30.960
(I'd like to invite you for tea.)

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.920
Look.

00:30:33.119 --> 00:30:34.440
"Do you have time lately?

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.200
I'd like to invite you for tea."

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.119
Ye Liangyin.

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:38.839
Do you know who Ye Liangyin is?

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:40.480
A chief auctioneer.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.079
I met her at a wine party.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.839
The goddess of my dreams

00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:45.160
is asking me out for tea.

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:47.000
By the way,

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.240
how do I look?

00:30:48.244 --> 00:30:50.200
Do you think
I've put on a bit of weight lately?

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.519
You're nuts.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.480
Oh, right.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.960
Watch the stall for me.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.288
I've got to go back and clean up.

00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:56.960
No way.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.000
I don't know how to price your junk.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.160
Sell it however you want.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.799
No one's buying anyway.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.839
You...

00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:10.640
That reminds me of something.

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.079
You can paint, right?

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:13.359
I've got a job for you.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.480
Miss Ye.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.880
This path isn't easy to walk.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.799
Watch your step.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.680
Please come in, Miss Ye.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:39.480
Miss Ye.

00:31:39.688 --> 00:31:40.510
Please have a seat.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.480
It's an honor

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.799
you'd grace me with your presence.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:50.839
Master Dong.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.079
Miss Ye.

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:53.279
My butler.

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:54.200
Master Dong.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.240
Will you have

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.000
your usual?

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:56.759
Black tea?

00:31:56.759 --> 00:31:57.519
Yes.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.640
Mr. Dong!

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.880
I've finally caught you!

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:05.839
Oh, you have a guest.

00:32:05.977 --> 00:32:07.160
I hope I'm not interrupting.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.119
Not at all.

00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:10.240
I'm a student in archeology
at Ninghai University.

00:32:10.244 --> 00:32:11.555
I've attended your lectures.

00:32:11.577 --> 00:32:12.750
They were outstanding.

00:32:12.755 --> 00:32:13.240
Is that so?

00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:14.640
It's an honor to meet you.

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:17.160
Oh, this is an outline
my supervisor, Mr. Tang,

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.559
asked me to show you.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Please go through it.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
All right.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.519
I won't disturb you any longer.

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:23.400
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.440
Goodbye.

00:32:27.599 --> 00:32:28.839
Fame can be

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.359
a burden.

00:32:32.599 --> 00:32:34.839
You do live up to your reputation

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:36.200
as a seasoned collector.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.119
Hardly.

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:38.440
I know a bit about tea.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.759
And I know papers.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.680
But who is she?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.799
She's an artist I hired

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.240
to capture the moment of our meeting.

00:32:52.977 --> 00:32:53.830
Is the painting ready?

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:54.480
Bring it to me.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.590
I can't believe this.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.000
Clearly,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.880
this is...

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.279
You've got technique,

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:14.920
but no conviction.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.400
Your style's all over the place.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.359
This is just a showing-off technique.

00:33:19.422 --> 00:33:20.200
Take it back.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:20.839
Repaint it.

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:21.480
Wait.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.799
Let me see it.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:26.240
Miss Ye.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.200
It's not bad.

00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:37.160
I like it.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:38.680
Miss Ye

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.200
certainly has good taste.

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:42.559
Since you like it,

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:43.720
I'll give it to you.

00:33:44.533 --> 00:33:45.270
You're done here.

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:45.839
Leave us.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.440
Enjoy.

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.920
Please enjoy your tea.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.640
Excellent tea.

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:09.719
I see you know a thing or two
about tea as well, Miss Ye.

00:34:10.039 --> 00:34:11.559
I only know a little.

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:13.880
You're far too modest.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.840
By the way, Master Dong.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:16.920
I've heard

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.159
you have a gallery

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.440
with quite a collection.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:20.800
Could I see it?

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.559
I didn't think you'd know

00:34:24.559 --> 00:34:26.039
about my little private gallery.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.679
Of course, you can.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.599
Is it far?

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:29.719
It's in the back hall.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.079
If it isn't too much trouble...

00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:32.239
Not at all!

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.599
We can go right now.

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:34.400
Please, Miss Ye.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.519
This way.
