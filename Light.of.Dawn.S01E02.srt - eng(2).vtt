I asked you to keep Uncle Zhao
company and talk to him.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.750
I am getting the red seal ready.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.520
Certified Public Accountant Wu,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.710
what are you looking for?

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.710
Are you looking for this?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.910
The CPA exam.

00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:46.590
Six subjects passed in one year.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.080
That's impressive.

00:02:48.222 --> 00:02:50.000
Not many in the nation
can do that.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.840
You're amazing.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.120
Just like you.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.630
I'm not well-educated.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.400
I graduated from the school of life.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.910
Unlike you all,
graduates of top schools.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.120
Alright.

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:01.870
Find a spot and get ready for photos.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.800
Okay.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.960
By the way, Wu...

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.933
I want to take a photo with you.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.520
(I'm Wu Feifei.)

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.310
(Objectively speaking,)

00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.710
(my family background is good.)

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.840
(In my circle,)

00:03:24.844 --> 00:03:26.430
(young people fall into two types.)

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.466
(One type drags their parents down.)

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.430
(The other is dependable.)

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.360
(This type enjoys exams,)

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:34.000
(enjoys self-improvement,)

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.150
(and enjoys challenges
in modern society.)

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.630
(And spends money on these things.)

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.080
(I always thought
I was the second type.)

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.400
(Until just now...)

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.150
(I killed a woman.)

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.340
=Episode 2=
=Princess=

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.600
What's wrong?

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:44.190
Let's go. Something happened.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.830
(The root of everything)

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.510
(was a plate of
undercooked fried yellow croaker.)

00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:52.240
(Uncle Zhao Qiang was)

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.844
(Mr. Zhao Qiang Memorial Service)
(a major shareholder of Penglai Group.)

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.360
(At a farmhouse restaurant,)

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.390
(he ate undercooked
fried yellow croaker,)

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.950
(triggering an old illness)

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.270
(and passed away.)

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.830
(Uncle Zhao had no children.)

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.720
(The ownership of his shares
became an issue.)

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.190
(And we hoped his widow, Li Ling,)

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.800
(would stand with us.)

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800
President Xu's opinion

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.977
is what matters most, right?

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.120
Then wouldn't he listen to President Wu?

00:05:16.288 --> 00:05:18.160
Li Ling has no right
to inherit the shares.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.120
- Exactly.
- Then what will she do?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.510
Why didn't Vice President Liu come?

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.920
He wouldn't come.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.000
Why would he?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.310
The shares became
the target of everyone.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.040
It still depends on President Wu.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.390
President Wu.

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:37.955
Please accept our condolences.

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:40.680
Our condolences.

00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:42.955
Our condolences.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.190
Vice President Liu came last night.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.680
He said he had other matters today

00:05:50.977 --> 00:05:51.920
and wouldn't come.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.040
Next, please welcome the chairman,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.480
Mr. Wu Guohao, to give a speech.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.430
Most of those here today are my elders.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.830
By rights,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.000
it shouldn't be my place to speak.

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:29.644
But Uncle Zhao passed away suddenly.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.310
My father is deeply saddened.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.240
I believe everyone present

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.240
is also deeply saddened.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.510
After all, we fought and bled together

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.488
(Mr. Zhao Qiang Memorial)
for Penglai Group.

00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:44.920
We're brothers and family
who made great contributions.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.800
If anyone has anything to say,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.600
you should at least show
some respect to the chairman.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.800
If everyone wants to talk,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.190
then let's talk today.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.000
Go on, say it.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.950
How do you plan to divide
Zhao's shares?

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.270
Vice President Liu.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.630
Why don't you start?

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.390
Let them fight over it.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.480
Uncle Zhao and I never registered
our marriage till the end.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.120
If we had, I could've
helped your father.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.680
Now you're in the same position as me,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.680
without legitimacy or standing.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.950
Have you ever thought there's a way

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.190
to help your father?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.600
I know.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.600
Where's Uncle Ming?

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.170
Get the car.
Let's go to the hospital.

00:08:40.177 --> 00:08:41.111
Your father fainted.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:41.720
Hurry!

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.980
(Emergency Department)

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.510
You are awake.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.910
How did I fall?

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.200
Do I look bad?

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.670
Looks like you're fine.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.440
I'm fine now.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.910
Alright.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.910
Then let's talk business.

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:25.977
Li Ling and Zhao Qiang
weren't legally married.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.080
So Li Ling

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.360
has no right to the shares.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.670
Zhao Qiang has no other heirs.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.670
His shares

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.150
will be up for purchase and transfer

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:34.390
at the shareholders' meeting.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.080
Uncle Ming found out

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.910
(that Liu Bin is fully prepared.)

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.550
(He's arranged funds and bids,)

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.630
(but to make the final move,)

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.480
(he still needs approval
from all shareholders.)

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.870
(Among them,)

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.750
(only He Mingli and Gao Lin
are on your side.)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.720
Liu Bin is easy to manipulate.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.670
So what we need now

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.480
is the support from Uncle Xu's old team.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.550
Very good.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.150
You've thought this through.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.960
It's time to hand the company

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.200
over to you young people.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.600
Wu.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.870
I'm going to marry Xu Zhiyang

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.630
immediately.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.240
Then do you

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.750
love him?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.630
(Have you ever thought there's a way)

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.550
to help your dad?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.480
If it's for love,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.550
and you're marrying to build a family,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.440
then Dad support it.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.200
But if it's for the company's benefit,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.480
that's why you're marrying...

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.080
Come in.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.790
Uncle Ming.

00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:24.533
The shareholders' meeting is set.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.240
Tomorrow afternoon.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.220
(Penglai Group)

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.844
Uncle Liu,
let's get straight to the point.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.910
I heard you're good at Guan Dan.
Is that right?

00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:36.870
So can I understand it this way?

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.030
You were my father's secretary.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.150
That's your strongest card.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.870
I was raised in the Wu family.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.720
That's the Wu family's strongest card.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.510
So you should partner with me.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.440
President Xu Jr., smart move.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.270
The biggest secret of Guan Dan
is cooperation.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.440
You can't each play your own cards,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.670
singing different tunes.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.360
Are you really sure

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.750
the Wu family
will always be on your side?

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.720
Yang.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.910
Penglai used to belong to the Xu family.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.840
It was taken over by others.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.840
In the future, it should still be Xu.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.360
Be the Wu family's puppet prince,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.870
or become Penglai's true President Xu

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.000
and build something real...

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.200
The choice is yours.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.270
The shareholders' meeting vote result.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.510
Director Xu Zhiyang

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.320
accepts General Manager
Zhao Qiang's shares.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.790
(Xu Zhiyang, let's get married.)

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.240
I only recently realized

00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:05.240
that we have been heading toward
marriage since childhood.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.870
So now that we're here,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.870
this should be

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.910
the best time for us to marry.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.240
Then you're not here to talk marriage.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.120
You're here to talk business.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.600
What's wrong with that?

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.840
Let's treat marriage
like a business deal.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.240
Business people are great.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.840
They follow rules and keep their word.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.390
In business,

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.000
both sides benefit.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.630
Feifei.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.270
Can our marriage be purer?

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.200
A pure marriage.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.960
Pure freedom.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.360
I hope I can have at least one.

00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:50.960
Feifei, please tell Mr. Wu the result,
on my behalf,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.390
and take good care of his health.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.790
Sorry, everyone.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.910
Please wait a moment.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.620
(Groom: Xu Zhiyang, Bride: Wu Feifei)

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.270
I can tell everyone is quite surprised.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.550
Right?

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.150
Indeed, it was unexpected,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.600
but also reasonable.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.910
Over the years,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.510
Penglai has had
many big and small problems.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.510
But in the end,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.720
it all came down to one question,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.200
the Xu or the Wu.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.670
But from today, from this moment on,

00:15:45.866 --> 00:15:47.511
that question no longer exists.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.150
Because we are family now.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.444
Everyone, please give us
a round of applause. Thank you.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.360
(Since my dad passed away,)

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.080
(I've been living with your family.)

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.720
It seems that from then on,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.840
we were forced into
this marriage arrangement

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.910
and lived with it.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.960
Yes, I should accept this reality.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.840
Don't worry.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.390
My dad and I won't treat you

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.377
like the puppet prince
people talk about.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.750
If

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.480
you still have concerns,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.840
we can sign a prenuptial agreement.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.080
There's a saying,

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.320
the only constant truth in this world

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.600
is change.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.240
The future is long.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.320
Let's settle the company matters first.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.480
As for our relationship,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.790
we can figure it out slowly, okay?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.440
(If it's because of love)

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.550
(that you two are getting married
and starting a family,)

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.480
(Dad supports you.)

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.830
(But if it's because
of company interests)

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.030
(that you're getting married,)

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.000
(I'd rather give up those shares.)

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.440
(This concerns)

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.110
(my daughter's entire future.)

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.110
(Do you understand what I mean?)

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.920
(Miss,)

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.880
(do you know who I am?)

00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.070
(Ever since I had a mobile phone,)

00:18:14.644 --> 00:18:16.750
(my password has always
been your birthday.)

00:18:20.777 --> 00:18:22.750
I want everyone
who came to this wedding,

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.977
even those already married,

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.440
to want to get married again.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.790
(I love you.)

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.160
(I want to marry you.)

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.030
(I can't promise)

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.000
(I'll be a perfect husband,)

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.240
(but I'll do everything I can
to treat you well.)

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.070
(Thank you, Big Dog.)

00:18:43.777 --> 00:18:45.240
(Thank you for telling me all this.)

00:18:45.888 --> 00:18:47.933
(I've called you Big Dog
since we were kids.)

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.640
(People say)

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.830
(only close buddies
call each other that.)

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.000
(But I call you that because)

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.550
(I feel you're always by my side.)

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.480
(Whenever I need you the most,)

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.070
(you're there.)

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.070
Wang Dan, right?

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.070
Congratulations.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.720
What should I call you now?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.200
Miss Wu as before,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.240
or Mrs. Xu instead?

00:19:41.711 --> 00:19:43.022
Two hundred thousand.

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:44.480
Take the money and leave.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.400
Leave Binchuan.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.310
The young lady's way of thinking

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.720
is really different from others.

00:19:54.577 --> 00:19:57.070
This bag alone must be
worth tens of thousands.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.720
You might as well bring a trash bag

00:20:00.844 --> 00:20:02.733
and stuff three hundred thousand
in it for me.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.750
If money can solve it,

00:20:07.688 --> 00:20:09.755
why should I waste effort
on anything else?

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.070
I came to talk to you sincerely.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.510
I know

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.400
you urgently need money.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.000
So why not be more realistic?

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.200
Three hundred thousand
or five hundred thousand,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.750
I can do either.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.070
But I want a win-win result.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.920
Otherwise,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.160
I guarantee you won't get a single cent.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.070
Is that so?

00:20:53.755 --> 00:20:56.790
If these videos were
accidentally uploaded online,

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.044
when do you think would be appropriate?

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.880
Would it be trending
on your wedding day?

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.160
That's blackmail.

00:21:07.688 --> 00:21:09.440
What exactly am I blackmailing you for?

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.590
I haven't even stated my terms yet.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.000
What terms?

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.270
I...

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.720
can also be Mrs. Xu.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.440
Do you believe I'll kill you?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.160
You really overestimate yourself.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.310
He was just impulsive,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.155
looking for someone
to sleep with, understand?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.830
But sleeping
with the same woman continuously

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.920
is a different matter.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.680
And what makes you so special?

00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:45.355
Having a powerful dad?

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.480
You were just born lucky.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.880
Yes.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.750
Right now, Xu Zhiyang treats me

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.844
like someone he can summon
or dismiss at will.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680
So what?

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.590
I truly cared about him.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.830
He could hold me and cry,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.510
and tell me a few heartfelt words.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.270
I also know

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.400
that your Penglai Group
originally had the surname Xu,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.200
not Wu.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.720
Did he ever tell you that?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.350
Did he even dare to mention it?

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.510
Miss,

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.750
he married you for the company.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.830
Your body isn't even
as attractive as mine.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.640
If my story gets exposed,

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.720
(what will you lose? Love?)

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.640
(Your dignity?)

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.350
(Or the company's image?)

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.440
(Or maybe all of that...)

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.880
You never had anyway.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.440
Men

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.310
won't follow you

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.030
forever.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.830
You evil lady!

00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:20.111
(The root of everything wasn't the
undercooked fried yellow croaker.)

00:23:20.644 --> 00:23:22.600
(It was that I myself
wasn't fully mature.)

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.380
(Xiangbin Tunnel)

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.660
(Wu)

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.620
(Wu)

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.460
(Wu)

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.240
Everyone is waiting for you at home.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.350
Li Ling even brought a pufferfish.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.590
What's wrong?

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.750
What's wrong?

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.720
Stay where you are.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.200
I'll ask Uncle Ming to find you.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.240
I'm fine.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.680
I'll be home soon.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.350
Feifei,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.750
about this marriage
between you and Yang,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.270
you grew up together and are close.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.680
We all know that.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.590
But outsiders don't.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.070
Not just the whole group,

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.110
but all of Binchuan

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.070
are watching closely.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.070
So it must be handled properly,

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.030
steadily.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.110
Otherwise,

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.920
the group will be affected as well.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.830
(A close friend once told me)

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.510
(that someone named Locard said,)

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.240
(every crime)

00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:41.577
(is inevitably accompanied
by material exchange.)

00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:43.680
(This place is remote enough.)

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.350
(No one around.)

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.720
(No surveillance nearby either.)

00:28:24.822 --> 00:28:26.444
(Wang Dan: Fine, Xu Zhiyang, just wait.)

00:28:26.444 --> 00:28:30.260
(Xu Zhiyang: Why aren't you
answering my calls?)

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:40.140
(Xu Zhiyang: Why aren't you
answering my calls?)

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.560
(I've made it very clear. We're over.)

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.700
(Don't pull this sneaky revenge crap.)

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.440
Sorry,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.350
the number you have dialled
is unavailable.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.590
Please try again later.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.750
(Tell me the truth.)

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.510
Did you see Wang Dan?

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.880
Why did you go see her?

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.510
I cut it off for you.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.400
You don't know...

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.000
She has videos of me.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.110
I know.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.030
She even showed me.

00:30:17.933 --> 00:30:19.310
What did you do to her?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.160
Feifei, Wang Dan is my mistake.

00:30:26.777 --> 00:30:28.844
I promise I'll cut her off completely.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.440
Let me handle this.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.070
Please.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.240
Xu Zhiyang, can I still trust you?

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.480
Yes, I know.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.920
I know you're very angry right now.

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:47.880
Later, take it all out on me.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.830
I won't fight back or talk back.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.000
But right now, we must stand together.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.590
Let me meet her once.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.070
Okay?

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.000
You still want to see her?

00:31:01.555 --> 00:31:02.640
You can't let her go?

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.030
Can you stop being so impulsive?

00:31:04.244 --> 00:31:05.590
You don't understand her at all.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.790
If you push someone like her,
she's capable of anything.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.111
What kind of person is she then?

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.590
You know her best, right?

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.720
I told you I cut her off completely,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.890
yet you still want to see her.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.333
Do you even want this marriage?

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.400
Feifei, we've been together
for so many years.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.720
How I feel about you,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.310
you should know better than anyone.

00:31:32.533 --> 00:31:34.333
But you never gave me any response.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.830
Honestly,

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.030
I never even hoped

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.440
that we'd end up together.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.070
I know Wang Dan is vain and shallow.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.880
Once she grabs a man, she won't let go.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.960
I know all of that.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.880
But I have to admit,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400
what she gave me

00:31:51.822 --> 00:31:53.755
is something you never wanted to give.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.790
You asked if I don't want this marriage.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:00.480
How could I not want to get married?

00:32:00.644 --> 00:32:01.790
You have no idea that day,

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.200
when you told me about
getting married, how happy I was.

00:32:04.266 --> 00:32:06.244
But I felt guilty.
I was scared to marry you.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.070
It's all my fault for causing trouble.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.160
I have to see Wang Dan.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.350
Trust me.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.000
I must meet her face to face

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.030
and end it completely.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.400
But if you don't agree,

00:32:16.622 --> 00:32:18.488
I really don't know what might happen.

00:32:18.777 --> 00:32:20.750
Then we'll have to postpone the wedding.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.111
And don't transfer
your dad's shares yet.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.420
(Hospital Ward)

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.200
What's wrong, girl?

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.240
Something happened?

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.200
You seem distracted.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:45.480
No.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.830
I can tell your mind's elsewhere.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.350
If something happened

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.200
and you can solve it yourself,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.270
that's an ability.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.790
If you can't solve it yourself,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.440
look for a friend.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:07.310
That's skill.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.310
If even friends can't help,

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.270
look for your dad.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.030
What's that called?

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200
That's family.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.480
Your dad isn't old yet.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:24.440
Yes.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.750
Let's calm down for a while.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.750
Take care of yourself.

00:33:47.066 --> 00:33:48.200
Do whatever you want.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.070
Just don't let my dad know

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.270
about your mess.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.480
Go wherever you want.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.110
Sorry.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.000
Lan.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.920
Yun.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.480
Not wearing a jacket? Aren't you cold?

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.190
Not cold.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.670
Lan.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:30.840
Heading out?

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.760
Where is she?

00:34:48.844 --> 00:34:50.933
She went back to her hometown
half a month ago.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.550
She still owes rent.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.760
Half a month ago?

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.630
You see,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.670
no one's here.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.960
Lan,
I won't beat around the bush.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.280
You're a well-known landlady here.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.480
But your apartments

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.920
are only rented to single women.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:27.920
What they do,

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:29.880
I know very well.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400
You know?

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.110
Then you walked into the tiger's den.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.630
I'm just the landlord.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.000
They're tenants.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.670
I only care about money.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.710
What they do is none of my business.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.920
Late-night food delivery,
and door-to-door.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.000
We checked this number.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.760
It's under your brother's name.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.440
There are six cars in total.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840
Your brother's job

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.190
is to drive these girls

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.070
back here every night.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.590
Their earnings go into your account.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.920
You say you don't manage
what happens inside,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.230
but you close your eyes and
open doors to make money.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.800
What you're doing,

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.000
am I not clear enough?

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.480
How big a deal is this Wang Dan
to your family,

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.280
to investigate her so thoroughly?

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.000
Is it necessary?

00:36:32.155 --> 00:36:34.030
I'm not trying
to make things hard for you.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.800
I just want to know where she is.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.480
Three years ago, she rented my place.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.000
I never raised her rent.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.630
Consider it a good deed.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.630
Mainly, she's not a bad person.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.510
We became close, like sisters.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.000
Also,

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.230
that girl is really pitiful.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.550
How pitiful?

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.110
Digging for men in the trash every day.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.400
How could she not be pitiful?

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.840
Earlier on,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.880
she met a vice president
of a small bank.

00:37:00.977 --> 00:37:02.440
He said he was getting a divorce.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.590
Then she got pregnant,

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.590
and had an abortion.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.800
He paid her some money and ran off.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.440
Later, she met a freight company owner.

00:37:10.488 --> 00:37:11.670
She said he was single.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.710
I thought they'd finally make it.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.360
Turns out his wife showed up

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.280
with a group of people.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.280
They broke two of Wang Dan's ribs.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.670
After that, there was your man.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.320
I even thought Wang Dan was lucky.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.800
Lan, none of that concerns me.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.840
I just want to know where she is now.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.710
You're really talking light
while standing on safe ground.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.760
That won't work with me.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.230
Someone already paid
to make Wang Dan disappear.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.360
I'm a person with principles.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.630
People like you walking on land

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.230
will never understand

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.440
how hard it is to survive underwater.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.960
You upper-class people, what do you
think Wang Dan is to you?

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.880
She thought she'd grabbed a lifeline,

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.760
but in the end, you people

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.710
just spat her out.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360
Even so,

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.630
I bet she'll rise again.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.960
Don't expect to get

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.030
any information about Wang Dan from me.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:18.840
Hello?

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.710
Miss, we've located Wang Dan.

00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:37.244
Why did you hide it from me?

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.840
Say something.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.800
Is it fun playing me?

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.550
(When something happens,)

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.320
(if you can handle it yourself,)

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.440
(that's an ability.)

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.550
(If you can't,)

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.280
(look for a friend.)

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.280
(That's skill.)

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.400
(If friends can't help,)

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.280
(look for your dad.)

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.230
(That's family.)

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.630
(Your dad's not that old yet.)

00:40:23.022 --> 00:40:24.510
(Even if I'm shattered to pieces,)

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.070
(so what?)

00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:29.030
(I have to stand strong at least once.)
