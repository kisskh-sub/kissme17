00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.480
Your Highness.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.720
I brewed a cup of calming tea for you.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.840
Where is this little eunuch from?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.400
He looks quite adorable.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.320
I haven't seen him

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.160
in the palace before.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.600
Newcomer.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.200
This eunuch

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.680
entered not long ago.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.280
There's nothing.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.480
You may leave.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.120
Yes.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.240
Don't have stray thoughts.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.360
Wait.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.400
Turn around.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.920
Okay, you may leave.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.160
Your Highness, sorry.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.600
Your Highness, sorry.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.160
I'll change your clothes.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.680
No, no.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.400
No need.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.080
No need.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.160
I'll take my leave.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.720
Mai Tian.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.960
Mai Tian.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.160
Mai Tian.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.400
Don't worry.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.240
I promised you.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.160
I will definitely do it.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.160
Epimedium.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.720
The Crown Princess

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.120
used epimedium on me?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.120
Someone.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.280
Here.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.680
Go to the Archives.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.440
I want to see what the diaries

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.320
record about this.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.320
Yes.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.320
His Majesty has arrived!

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.360
His Majesty?

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.520
It's actually the Emperor?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.520
Father.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.960
Today,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.600
the Prime Minister and I come together

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.520
to discuss important matters with you.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.240
Where have you been?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.680
Why the long delay?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.160
I...

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.480
I was investigating something.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.840
Regarding the imperial exam fraud

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.480
you mentioned earlier in court...

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.920
Father,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.800
I have a more urgent matter.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.880
The Prime Minister is here.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.560
Other matters can wait.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.280
This concerns the Crown Princess

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.680
and also her father,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.120
the Prime Minister.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.440
Qiu Yi.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.760
Let me ask you.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.920
Who is the father of the baby

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.160
in your womb?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.640
What do you mean?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.960
Could it be

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.680
that you suspect me?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.520
(Diaries)
The diaries record

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.920
we never shared a bed after our wedding.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.320
May I ask how you became pregnant?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.840
Perhaps the diaries

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.440
merely omitted it.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.400
Oh?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.440
The diaries record

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.120
that after our wedding,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.560
I kept traveling outside

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.640
and rarely returned.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.280
Shall we get an imperial physician

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.320
to date your conception

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.440
and see if I was in the palace that day?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.000
Someone.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.160
Go get a physician.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.280
Enough.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.720
Father.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.920
I said enough!

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.720
The diaries

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.800
were recorded incorrectly.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.160
That should be the case.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.200
Father.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.920
But the Crown Prince

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.960
harbors doubts.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.520
The child in the Crown Princess' womb

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.200
cannot be kept.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.320
Your Majesty!

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.440
The Crown Princess

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.240
hasn't visited
her family home for so long.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.080
Prime Minister,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320
you know what to do, correct?

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.120
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.760
Your Majesty,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.080
I have an important matter to report.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.240
What is it now?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.000
I have investigated

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.520
the woman the Crown Prince married

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.760
in the countryside.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.040
She is the daughter

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.000
of Shen Jinyuan, the criminal minister

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.200
who was executed
along with his entire family back then.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.200
Is this true?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.800
Father.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.480
The Shen family was framed.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.440
Please clear Mr. Shen's name.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.280
Your Highness.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.920
It seems you truly have amnesia.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.600
Do not forget that back then,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.600
the one who issued the edict
to execute the entire Shen family

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.640
was none other than His Majesty!

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.440
The remnants of the Shen family

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.360
naturally

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.360
shall be eliminated.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.520
Father.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.040
Father.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.040
Please see clearly.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.520
The Shen family was truly framed.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.520
Remember.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.440
You were born into the imperial family.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.200
Prioritize the greater good
in all matters.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.760
Is this "greater good"

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.720
worth the truth?

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.480
How dare you!

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.240
From today, the Crown Prince
is confined to his palace.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.920
Without my decree,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.400
you are not to leave.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.080
Father.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.000
Father.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.720
Let go!

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.520
Father.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.120
Father, please see clearly!

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.760
Let go! Let go!

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.920
Father.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.600
Enough.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.440
Your Highness.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.560
A daughter of a disgraced official

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.160
raised in the countryside.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.720
Killing her

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.120
is of no consequence.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.600
Father.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.400
Father, please see clearly.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.400
Why?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.400
Why are you the son
of my father's killer?
