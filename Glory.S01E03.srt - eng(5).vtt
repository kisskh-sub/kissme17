00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.910
[Episode 3]

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:35.640
You're mean!

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.759
-You're so harsh!
-Behave yourself.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:37.640
Let me go!

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.170
Let me go!

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.840
Don't move.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.759
You cursed wretch!

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.890
How many more in my family
do you want to harm?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.020
Shanbao.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410
You're still helping her?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.350
It's all because of her

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.550
that Mother fell ill,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.480
that all the medicines didn't work,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.920
and that she passed away so early.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.560
That idiot who never grows up,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230
what's the use of keeping her alive?

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.150
Wanwan is innocent and pure,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.560
knowing nothing of the world.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.520
Mother gave her life

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.590
in exchange for hers.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.450
I won't let you harm her in any way.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.170
Wanwan, don't be afraid.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.890
I'm here.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.240
Silly Wanwan.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.440
Don't believe what she says.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.870
No one in the Rong family hates you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.930
more than she does.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.190
She wishes you dead even in her dreams.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.190
Once you're dead,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.680
the lie becomes the truth.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.360
Rong Yunyin, how dare you!

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.560
What?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.860
Is she your only blood sister?

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.910
Wasn't I born

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.310
of the same mother as you?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.290
We're both your blood sisters,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.230
yet you treat her better than me!

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.030
Guards!

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.790
Miss Rong.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.190
Search!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.000
Yes.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.560
Lock the courtyard gates.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.020
No one is allowed in or out.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.530
You, go search over there.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.150
Stop hitting me. Stop.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.079
Stop hitting me.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.400
Please spare me, Young Master.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.000
I won't dare do it again.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.730
Who's there?

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.560
Have you lost your mind
in front of Miss Rong?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.160
What are you babbling about?

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.870
Miss Rong.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.780
What are you doing here?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.710
I...

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.650
During the day, I dropped

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.530
a wooden bucket in the garden.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.410
Afraid of being beaten
by the steward tomorrow,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.560
I wanted to sneak back and retrieve it

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.560
while the household
was busy with the banquet.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.870
But I ran into Mr. Wang,

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.730
who beat me without a word.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.680
When I heard all the noise just now,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.160
I thought he had returned.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.280
And I just panicked.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.280
What an insolent thief!

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.050
How audacious you are,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.000
to be caught red‑handed
and still dare to lie.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.530
Take him away immediately.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.420
No need to trouble the officials.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.159
Give him thirty strokes first.

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:42.810
I would never dare to lie.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.550
Never!

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.650
Right.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.830
This jade pendant,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.830
I tore it from him

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.159
in my panic.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.110
Miss Rong.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.870
I've checked, and all the guards

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.950
were at their posts.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.070
Among those not on duty,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.360
only this stable boy

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.910
stayed alone in the shed.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.720
The rest

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.120
can vouch for each other.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960
They never went to Qilan Garden.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.710
As for Xinfang Pavilion,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.360
during the gathering, Mr. Song, Mr. Lin,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.270
and Mr. Wang all left their seats
at different times,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.270
and their whereabouts are unknown.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.530
Miss Rong, he truly didn't lie.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.460
This wooden bucket

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.120
was indeed left in the garden.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.600
It seems someone named Wang
was causing trouble.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.850
What's his name?

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.920
Miss Rong.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.960
His name is

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.600
Wang...

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.830
Wang Lu.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.960
That's right.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.250
His name is Wang Lu.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.600
Wang Lu?

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.870
Fire! Fire!

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.190
Help! It's on fire!

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.190
It's coming from Xinfang Pavilion.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.830
Miss Rong, what else should I do?

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.390
Lift your head.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.880
It's such a lively scene.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.110
You should come along too.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.240
Miss Rong, it's my fault

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.000
for being negligent with Mr. Wen.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.730
Thankfully,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.430
he wasn't hurt badly.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.890
Miss...

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.700
Bao.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.800
Bao.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.190
You...

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.480
You'd better escort Mr. Wen

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.360
back to his room to rest.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.830
Yes.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.160
Only flawless jade
is worthy of being paired.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.330
He is that useless.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.750
Even ten guards

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.630
would fail to keep his virtue intact.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.830
Who set the fire?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.159
I saw Mr. Wen

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.950
was drunk

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.830
and feared he might fall,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.290
so I quietly followed him.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.390
Then I saw someone sneaking

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.040
into his room under cover of night.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.830
I couldn't make a fuss
but couldn't do nothing either,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.630
so I used smoke to drive them off.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.800
I acted out of urgency
and couldn't inform anyone beforehand.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.460
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.950
Fire! Fire!

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.560
Fire!

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.200
Fire!

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.330
Miss Rong.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.570
The guests have all been settled.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.720
Luckily, nothing serious happened.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.310
Just

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.260
one of Young Master's
brocade robes got burned.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.290
You silly fool.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.750
There are plenty of silk
and cloth in the guest rooms.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.350
Just burn whatever you like.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.330
Why would you burn your own clothes?

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.059
You're not so clever yourself.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.360
Perhaps that's exactly

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.600
what he wanted you to ask.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.780
None of those things belong to me.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.600
Wen Can is tall

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.100
and completely drunk.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.160
A frail woman would
have trouble handling him.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.620
Didn't you see anyone else

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.060
when you came?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.820
Forgive me for arriving late.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.240
I didn't see anyone else.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
Thanks for your help, Young Master.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.120
Steward Cheng.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.650
Escort him back to his room.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.010
Yes.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.610
Mr. Bai, this way please.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.390
Miss Rong.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.840
After the fire,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.000
everyone was either in their rooms

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.200
or in the Flower Hall.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.030
Only Song Yifang,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.600
Lin Shishuo, and Wang Lu

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.400
arrived late.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.320
That Wang Lu in particular

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.450
was hesitant and unclear in his words.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.240
So they actually went wandering
in the garden at night.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.180
Since we don't know which one it was,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.580
detain all three of them.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.780
Yunyin, watch your words.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.000
Miss Rong.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.730
I have something important to report.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.960
Don't stop me!

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.150
Give me two more drinks.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.390
Tell Mr. Bai that

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.630
I can drink more.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.570
Alright, alright.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.400
Don't help me.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:15.790
Wine.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.670
-Young Master. -Let me drink.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.630
I'm here with Young Master.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.430
You may leave.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.960
-Yes. -One more drink.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.070
Young Master.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.000
How many went tonight?

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.670
Fifteen.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.510
Still too slow.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.280
More drinks.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.630
Bring me good wine.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.790
-The best one.
-Okay, okay.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.600
More drinks.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.120
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.670
I'm the one who accidentally entered

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.930
Qilan Garden tonight.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.120
Didn't you already cover it up?

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.280
Miss Rong, you're sharp‑eyed.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.730
I might fool others,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.900
but I could never fool you.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.630
What are you trying to do,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.240
sneaking into Qilan Garden at night

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.210
to eavesdrop on me and my sister?

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.720
After falling from the cliff,

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.720
I should have been dead.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.960
It was only by your kindness
that I was taken in,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.630
treated, and kept alive.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.280
I came to Qilan Garden

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.790
because there is a matter
of great importance.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.550
Go ahead.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.320
Please wait a moment, Miss.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.710
Indenture?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.330
I trespassed into Qilan Garden
late at night

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.210
only because our difference in status

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.840
forbade me from
speaking with you privately.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.200
Miss Rong, your grace in saving my life

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.260
is beyond measure.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.440
How could it ever be repaid

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.480
by merely tending a few horses

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.680
or doing menial work?

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.150
Miss Rong, if you don't despise me,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.870
I'm willing to be your servant,

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.000
and do whatever you command,
serving you for all my days.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.030
From now on, if you bid me live,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.400
I shall live.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.670
If you bid me die,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.150
I shall die.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.450
In life and in death,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.870
I belong to you alone.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.980
Should I ever betray this vow,
may Heaven itself deny me mercy.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.810
You want to be a servant
of the Rong family?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.260
Not the Rong family's.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400
Yours.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.320
Listen and tell me

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.020
whether I am right.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.070
Covered in injuries,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.360
you feared you had made
some enemies outside,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.630
so you dare not leave
the Rong family lightly.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.890
You came to me secretly

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.800
because you want
to discover your identity.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.400
After overhearing a few words
between Yunyin and me,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.510
you feared that Yunyin might harm you.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.440
So you intend to use this indenture

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.510
to secure a way out through me.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.560
Am I right?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.200
I beg you to see the sincerity

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.980
of my heart, Miss Rong.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.840
You're clearly desperate to survive,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.040
with no other choice.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.840
Yet you present yourself
with such honesty and sincerity,

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.350
with a clear sense of gratitude and duty.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.740
Having someone of your talent
serving in the Rong family

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.940
is quite a gain for me.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.870
Well. Go to Xinfang Pavilion

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.200
and take good care of Wen Can.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.330
Miss Rong, your request

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.270
is not something I should refuse.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.320
But I'm just a lowly person.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.750
I still live in that shack

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.870
and need to tend the horses.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.950
It's hard for me to fulfill both duties.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.750
He's trying all sorts of ways

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.150
to get better treatment.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.150
Besides,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.080
Xinfang Pavilion
is full of important guests,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.940
none of whom are easy to deal with.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.400
With my unknown background and low status,

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.590
I fear I cannot handle it,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.640
thus failing your trust.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.230
You saw it yourself tonight.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.480
There is constant danger

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.680
surrounding Wen Can.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.720
I can't always be by his side.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.740
So I need someone sharp-eyed
and clear-minded

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.070
to keep him out of danger

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.970
and turn bad luck into good.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.010
After it's done,

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.910
I'll have someone
investigate your identity

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.480
and send you where you belong.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.480
Do you truly mean it, Miss Rong?

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.270

Come out!

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.240
It's Mr. Song.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.100
Search him.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.550
Yes.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.270
Gilded entwined-branch candlestick
from the Flower Hall.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.350
What a well-bred gentleman you are.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.350
By law,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.590
the thief shall be beaten
eighty times with a rod.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.030
Yes.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.960
Please have mercy, Ms. Yan.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.020
Please have mercy.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.170
Though my family has a noble title,

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.480
we are in ruin.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.110
I am…

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.960
I am utterly desperate.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.020
That's why I did it.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.090
Please show leniency, Ms. Yan.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.150
With conduct like this,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.280
you've truly sullied your good looks.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.010
Ms. Yan, if you like it,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.300
I can have this candlestick

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.740
sent to your room.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.070
If you like it,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:36.480
I can leave

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.810
this candlestick here.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.000
Mr. Song, if you want to learn

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.510
how to stand on your own,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.920
I

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.240
can teach you some
of the rules in the Rong family,

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.840
so you can support yourself.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.370
It is far better than
starving in a fallen family.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.510
As for the noble Miss Rong,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.440
she's out of your reach.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.970
Let go of your hopes from now on.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:58.980
Your tea-making

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.010
has always been flawless.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.610
Yet the matter of your marriage

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.310
is always on my mind.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.070
Fifteen people went there yesterday.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.960
Do any of the remaining ones
catch your eye?

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:13.400
No.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.200
If none are to your liking,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.310
dismiss them and continue the search.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.110
Grandmother.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.440
The men who came this time

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.680
are all talented from various regions.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.010
There's no need to rush.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.710
From what I can see,

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.400
Shanbao still wishes to test

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.860
their character further.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.340
As long as you know what to do,
that's enough.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.510
Has anyone from the Yan family arrived?

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.960
The age card was sent earlier,

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.220
and they are probably still on their way.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.000
Ganlu Temple on Mount Meng

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.310
isn't far from here.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.090
Why are they taking so long?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.260
Lady Rong, shall we send someone?

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.480
Forget it.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.240
Judging by Bao's attitude,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.300
she won't make a choice anytime soon.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.490
So there's no need to hurry.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.830
Lady Rong.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.160
Yesterday, one of the rejected suitors,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.000
Song Yifang,

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.630
coming from a poor family,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.760
is willing to serve in the Rong family.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.510
I find him clever

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.320
and somewhat educated.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.000
Would you consider keeping him?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.270
You can handle
such matters as you see fit.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.440
Yes.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.550
Jingyi.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.140
You look

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.070
radiant today.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.750
Being able to serve
by your side, Lady Rong,

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.160
is a blessing for me.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.270
Grandmother still loves you the most,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.960
and truly wants you

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.360
to find someone perfect.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.350
You know,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.940
Grandmother gave me the right to choose,

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.750
but she didn't give me

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.410
the right not to choose at all.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.040

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.330
Call me Shanbao.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.110
Shanbao.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.400
They all forced me to drink last night.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.660
They know you favor me,

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.400
so they all want to harm me.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.750
Those men are all petty,

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.640
full of schemes,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.300
and definitely not your match.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.980
Could you send them all away?

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.100
No.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.270
If they don't leave,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.160
they'll surely gang up

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.930
to bully me.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.200
Shanbao.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.030
How can you be so stone-hearted,

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:42.940
so icy,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240
and so cruel?

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.780
Don't you care about me even a little?

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.940
If you can't handle it, you can leave.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.720
Shanbao.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.270
This person beside you

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.270
is quite capable.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.850
Feel free to use him.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.910
Why did Shanbao just praise you?

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.720
Miss Rong means that

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.480
if there's any danger,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.140
you can push me forward
to shield you at any time.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.590
Yesterday's banquet was a trap.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.750
Miss Rong has yet to make an appearance.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.600
What? Another trap today?

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.130
Mr. He, you're being too harsh.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.440
Miss Rong once said that

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.480
integrity is a gentleman's virtue.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.790
All the gentlemen

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.680
standing in this hall today

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.920
are men of impeccable character

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.980
and noble conduct.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.000
If that's the case,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.790
why hasn't Miss Rong shown herself yet?

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.400
Don't tell me she intends
to have a servant

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.630
evaluate those suitors on her behalf?

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.590
Marriage depends on character

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.680
as well as fate.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.200
Miss Rong intends

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.460
to invite one gentleman to dine with her.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.790
That's why she sent me here today.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.240
Invite whom?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.040
Me, of course.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.720
All gentlemen,

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.030
please have a gift ready.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:13.790
Whoever's gift

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.190
catches Miss Rong's eye,

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.510
she will host a banquet at Qilan Garden.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.960
You have three days.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.750
Mr. Wen, you and Miss Rong

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.750
grew up together.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.920
Do you know what

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.830
Miss Rong likes?

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.030
Right, tell us!

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.720
Tell us.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.270
Tell us.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.470
Shanbao likes sweets.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.240
The sweeter, the better.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.270
Sweets?

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.200
-The sweeter, the better.
-I'll buy it now.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.400
The sweeter, the better.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.550
The sweeter, the better.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.440
The sweeter, the better.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.590
The sweeter, the better.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.920
Mr. Wen, tell us more.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.380
What else? Please tell us.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.730
What else does she like?

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.800
Can we trust what he says?

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.590
Yes.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.110
Seems we can't.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.730
You're quite clever.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.760
Yesterday's alliance is over.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.470
Now that we're on our own.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:04.400
You...

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.930
You're bound to lose.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240
You poor scholar.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.680
Our Rong family has everything.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.440
Yet she

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.760
comes right away asking for gifts.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.350
People who don't know better

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.240
might think our Rong family

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.700
is full of shallow people.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.880
When you're eating at my place,

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.970
don't talk about such unpleasant things,

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.500
or you'll get indigestion.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.310
Yunxi.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.790
Have you read those age cards

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.900
I gave you last time?

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.680
Even if you marry

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.040
later than Rong Shanbao,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:00.880
you can't fall behind her

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.680
when it comes to bearing an heir.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.640
All I care about is cultivating tea.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.260
I don't really care about these matters.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.350
Indeed.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.890
Those men all seem quite ordinary.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.640
But there is a silly one.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.610
Mr. Bai, you...

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.740
Don't disturb others.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.470
He really is a silly one.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.920
I know my sister's preferences

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.070
very well.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.310
But in this world,

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.640
nothing comes for free.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.590
Mr. Rong, just tell us,

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.920
what we can do for you.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.010
Basic information costs one tael of gold.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.440
Decent information, ten taels.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.650
As for top-grade information,

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.400
fifty taels.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.830
Cash on delivery, fair and square.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.630
Young Master.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.000
Miss Rong requests that you

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.270
continue kneeling
outside the ancestral hall.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.030
Why?

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.420
Miss Rong said that

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.490
if you can sell out

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.370
her preferences for money today,

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.160
tomorrow

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.310
you could sell out
the Rong family for money.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.200
That's why you must be punished.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.920
Nonsense!

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.590
Am I the kind of person

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.110
who can't tell right from wrong?

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.680
Besides,

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.040
I haven't even taken the money yet!

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.540
You... what are you doing? What?

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.550
I... let me go! Let me go!

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.790
Let go of me!

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.700
-What are you doing?
-Gentlemen.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.160
I...

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.350
Don't waste your time

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.270
trying to know Miss Rong's tastes.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.030
You'd be better off using that time

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.030
to prepare a proper gift.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.440
Yes.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.920
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.360
What happened, Mr. Wen?

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.510
They're all wrong.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.750
What?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.000
Shanbao doesn't like anything.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.050
Ever since she was little,

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.270
she's been like a bodhisattva in a temple,

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.000
showing no preferences at all.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.350
Shanbao only needs to choose me,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.790
yet suddenly there are

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.320
so many meddlesome people.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.350
Why do they think

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.750
they can dine in her room?

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.540
Mr. Wen, don't worry too much.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.590
You and Miss Rong grew up together.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.720
No one else can match

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.190
that kind of connection.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.030
No wonder Shanbao said that

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.230
you're a capable man.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.240
You have reminded me.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.920
Miss Rong, something's happened
at the tea shop.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.670
[Second-grade goods of the Rong Family]

00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:59.270
Everyone.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:30:59.580
[Rong's Tea House]

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.790
I paid 3,000 taels of silver

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.790
for premium Mingqian Longjing Tea.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.690
But when it arrived in Guangzhou,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.110
I found it mixed with

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.270
dyed inferior tea!

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.680
That's impossible.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.310
Look, everyone.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.550
The tea's all cloudy.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.830
The Rong's Tea House is full of swindlers!

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.640
Swindlers?

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.510
That can't be right.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.160
Make way.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.610
Make way!

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.880
Miss Rong is here.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880
Miss Rong is here.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.590
Miss Rong.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.240
Miss Rong.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.500
Where's the goods?

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.350
I haven't even touched the seals yet.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.030
Miss Rong,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.540
you have to take responsibility.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.490
Scissors.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.810
What does this mean?

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:20.910
It looks like...

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.270
Mr. Liu.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:23.920
Miss Rong.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.550
I bought a new batch of tea

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.070
that hasn't been shipped yet.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.790
Bring it here.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.340
Yes.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.720
Look.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:44.490
Let's wait.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.960
How did this character appear?

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:58.720
It's a mark.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.580
There is a character underneath.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.350
The Rong family has always done business

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.920
honestly and fairly.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.310
Mr. Wang.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.280
What else do you have to say?

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.960
You can't leave! You can't leave!

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.550
Move aside!

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.510
You can't leave!

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.530
What kind of tea is this?

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.050
I'll beat you to death!

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.110
How dare you slander Miss Rong!

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.310
You must give Miss Rong an explanation!

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.310
She didn't even say much,

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.110
and it was all settled.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.070
The Rong family's centuries-old reputation

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.530
truly lives up to its name.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.000
Miss Rong

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.350
really stands out.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.520
The Rong family has gone too far.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.270
You know what to do.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.110
Yes.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.840
Miss Rong!

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.190
Miss Rong!

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.280
Miss Rong.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.469
Mr. Wen has been struck with severe pain,

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.310
sweating through three layers of clothes.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.590
Yet he refuses to call for a physician

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.050
and insists on seeing you.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.980
Please, Miss Rong,

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.260
go check on him now.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.760
Shanbao.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.890
After much thought,

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.340
I still don't know

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.400
what gift I should

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:36.930
give you.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.260
In the past, we grew up together

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.790
with deep affection.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:42.600
Shanbao.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.880
You're my older cousin,

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.710
but please don't always see me
as just a little brother.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.670
Time has passed,

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.940
and I've grown into a man now.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.660
I'm willing to conquer the world for you,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.400
and protect you

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.410
for all eternity.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.650
What are you doing?

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.710
Let me out!

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.800
Shanbao, let me out!

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.480
Shanbao, let me out!

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.400
Let me out!

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.500
Miss Rong said that

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.280
you can only come out

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.680
when you have recovered from your madness.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:14.920
Shanbao!

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.090
Shanbao, let me out!

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.000
I'm not being ridiculous.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.460
I'm serious.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:26.840
Miss Rong.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.320
The Young Master's gift

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.240
has been prepared.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.300
Please have a look.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.560
Miss Rong.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.430
Tonight is truly lively.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.030
Do you like it?

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.250
Miss Rong, please stay.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:58.690
Just look.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.880
Men in this world are often unfaithful,

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.440
only gold is steadfast.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.740
If I ever betray you in the future,

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.000
I will voluntarily leave
this household empty-handed,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.790
leaving this mountain of gold for you

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.140
to use for daily needs.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.230
Those suitors outside

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.090
only covet your vast tea plantations.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.580
They make empty promises, hoping
to gain much by investing little.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.310
Only I

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.590
dare to transform half my business empire

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:36.920
into a mountain of gold,

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.390
as a gift of my heart,

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.230
just to earn a place by your side.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.220
Put your clothes on.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.440
You don't like it?

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.690
I'd rather have

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.440
the freshly picked

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.300
imperial green buds from Xishan.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.860
[Rong Mansion]

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.880
What's going on with this weather?

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.840
Why is it so hot?

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.480
Mr. Wen, where's your gift?

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.190
Mind your own business.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.090
They are all mundane things.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:41.900
My gift

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.290
has already been given to Shanbao.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.290
What have you prepared?

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.400
Let me show you.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:48.840
Don't tell anyone else.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.190
Miss Rong has arrived!

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.850
She's here.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.120
Who's first?

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.150
I'll go first.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.950
I'll go first.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:29.920
Miss Rong.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:31.630
This is my family's heirloom
gold ornament.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.070
It has now been passed down

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.320
to the fifth generation with me.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320
What do you think?

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.830
Send him away.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.510
Why?

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.000
Even if you don't like it,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.280
you can't just send people away.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.340
This headdress comes from Ruifuxuan

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.290
and is worth 1,200 taels of silver.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.320
Am I right?

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.380
Guards.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.970
Send him away.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.630
Merchants value honesty above all.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.800
You may choose not to give anything,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.460
but you must not be deceitful.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.970
Our Rong family does not
tolerate unscrupulous people.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:10.120
These hairpins and jade ornaments
are common items.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.890
Miss Rong, please take a look

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.440
at my tea set.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.760
This set consists of
black-gold glazed cups

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.070
from the imperial court
of the early Song dynasty.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.000
It's priceless in today's market.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.550
I have painstakingly

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.310
sought it out for you.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:28.370
This time,

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.790
you'll definitely like my gift, right?

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.110
Indeed, it's nice.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.020
You may go.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.510
Miss Rong, look at this whip.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:15.810
How is it?

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:18.920
Not bad.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.070
Young Master, please.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.110
Miss Rong, please look at mine.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.060
Young Master, you may leave.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.960
What's this?

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.100
This is a copy of The Classic of Tea

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.580
that I personally transcribed and bound.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.220
Your handwriting is good.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.710
I... I used to

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.840
often help the headmaster copy books.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.480
I've seen all your gifts.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.800
Please take them back with you.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.280
What?

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.360
Miss Rong, are these gifts
not to your liking?

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.180
When I asked you to prepare gifts,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.040
I wasn't after your possessions.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.350
Gifts carry no measure of worth.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.710
They are entirely
a reflection of your hearts.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.240
The gifts you've presented

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:22.540
reflect

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.460
how much you value me.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.320
Now I know completely.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.240
So there is no need to accept the gifts.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.440
Our Rong family won't

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.240
let your efforts go unrewarded.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.590
This afternoon, I'll have someone deliver

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.420
return gifts of equal value.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.100
Then who will you dine with tonight?

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.080
Before dinner, I'll have the steward

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.430
personally extend the invitation.

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.030
You, come with me.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.260
Yes.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.190
[The Classic of Tea]

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.340
This is a copy of The Classic of Tea

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.730
that I personally transcribed and bound.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.920
The Classic of Tea is the earliest,

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.670
most complete, and most comprehensive

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:48.630
monograph on tea in China

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.480
and indeed the world.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.280
It consists of
three volumes and ten chapters,

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.880
earning the reputation
of an encyclopedia of tea.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.030
From cultivation methods
and the selection of utensils

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:00.710
to the techniques of brewing tea,
all are meticulously recorded,

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:02.000
making it

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.590
an ancient guide for tea.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:04.840
The author, Lu Yu,

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.150
even carefully designed a set of

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:07.550
specialized tea wares

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.920
for brewing and drinking tea.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.280
The Classic of Tea is

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.510
an important document for studying

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:12.670
ancient Chinese tea culture.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.800
It has promoted the popularity
of tea ceremonies,

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.440
and is one of the world's
three greatest tea classics.
