00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:26.140
=Manbo Destiny=

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.980
=Episode 5=

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.500
Song Pai.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.239
Instead of focusing on
the southern disaster,

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.039
you should first pay attention
to your Guan Mengmeng.

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:42.300
If someone like her were to become
a Princess of Manbo Kingdom,

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:43.900
it would truly make people

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.775
laugh their heads off.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.079
Father.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.639
Mengmeng came

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.839
to Manbo alone for my sake.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.159
Royal rules are numerous.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.439
Mengmeng was unable
to bear them for a time.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.799
I humbly dare

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.950
to request a pardon decree for Mengmeng.

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:08.887
Father.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.390
Guan Mengmeng's identity
is already in question.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.170
Granting her a pardon decree
would be inappropriate.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.679
Enough.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.850
The First Princess
has indeed come from afar,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.387
leaving her homeland behind.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.199
Her culture and customs

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.319
do differ greatly from ours.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.512
Since the First Prince

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.079
has raised this request,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.479
then I shall

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:34.887
grant her a pardon decree.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.879
Song Pai.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.799
However,

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:44.016
you must also pay a corresponding price

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:45.806
for this pardon decree.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.290
I am willing to accept punishment.

00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:51.462
As for governing
the southern flood disaster,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.759
you must give it your utmost effort.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.199
Yes.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.569
I shall not shirk this duty.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.500
Good.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.550
That will conclude
today's court session.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.919
You are dismissed.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.839
- We respectfully escort Your Majesty.
- We respectfully escort Your Majesty.

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:15.781
Song Pai.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.719
Do you really think
a single pardon decree

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.399
can protect Guan Mengmeng?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.599
Lin Ge.

00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:32.606
What exactly do you want?

00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:34.125
As long as I have it,

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.364
I can give it to you.

00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:38.275
But your sister-in-law,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.100
you are not allowed to touch.

00:03:16.191 --> 00:03:18.350
These useless people.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.189
They cannot
even catch a female con artist.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.639
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.725
Wait.

00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:40.679
You.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.099
Turn around.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.319
Her Majesty is talking to you.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.319
(I am done for.)

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.750
(I walked straight into the trap.)

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.879
Get up.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.639
Come over here.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.839
Lift your head.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.599
So it is you.

00:04:15.062 --> 00:04:16.061
Guards.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.239
The swindler is here.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.440
Take her.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.900
Yes.

00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:20.839
Well done, Guan Mengmeng.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.439
Let me go.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.999
With makeup on, hiding in the crowd,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.358
I almost did not recognize you.

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:25.799
Let you go?

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.987
You deceived the sovereign
and defied the throne.

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:29.186
Even Song Pai cannot protect you now.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.319
Maka.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.279
You old witch.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.150
You are asking for it.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.212
How dare you.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.079
First Prince.

00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:47.679
By the King's verbal decree,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.790
a pardon decree is bestowed
upon the First Princess.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.399
What?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.199
Your Highness.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.839
With this pardon decree,

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.481
no matter what Mengmeng did wrong,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.679
it is all wiped clean.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:09.674
Release her.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.959
I am sorry, Mengmeng.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.400
I came too late.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.999
If you were any later,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.359
I would have lost my life.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.355
Next time, do not run around alone.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.359
Oh.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.319
Does the wound still hurt?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.925
Let me see.

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:53.599
My Queen,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.959
you finally belong to me.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.199
Let go of me.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.759
My Queen, you cannot escape.

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:02.171
Let go of me.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.559
I said you cannot escape.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.639
It hurts.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.799
I was not trying to run.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.390
My real identity was exposed,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.830
and I was afraid you would
lose your chance at the succession.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.119
So I had no choice but to hide.

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:20.198
I am sorry.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.630
I do not know
what came over me just now.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.279
Are you alright?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.439
I am sorry, Mengmeng.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.959
Today, I dragged you into this.

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:30.684
Originally,

00:06:30.684 --> 00:06:31.963
I only planned to muddle through

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.759
the day we met His Majesty.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.799
Once the wedding was over,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.790
I would then, in the name of blessings,
ask for a pardon decree for you.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.039
So you had already thought
through a plan,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.439
yet you did not tell me anything.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.279
I never do anything without certainty.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.625
Are you sure that on the wedding day,

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.399
they will not cause trouble again?

00:06:56.412 --> 00:06:57.679
They do not have the nerve.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.159
As long as the wedding is over,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.920
and you become
the First Princess smoothly,

00:07:03.137 --> 00:07:04.819
they will no longer
pose a threat to you.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.879
Then in the future, will I not be

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.439
living as if walking beside a tiger?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.039
Do not worry.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.119
Once the wedding is over,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.359
you will get what you deserve.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.719
Then what are your plans going forward?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.319
The world is unpredictable.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.159
All I can do is make sure
every move is right.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.519
Cunning old fox.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.679
Do you remember the first day we met?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.479
Mm.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.039
The reason they
used Lin Ge to try to kill me

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.879
was because they were certain

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.850
that I would spare him
for the sake of brotherhood

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.150
and not pursue the matter further.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.319
They were far too arrogant.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.759
Anyone can kill with a borrowed knife.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.239
(This side of Song Pai is terrifying.)

00:08:05.562 --> 00:08:07.962
(MANBO NEWS)
The highly anticipated royal wedding is held today.

00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:09.799
The First Prince and the Second Prince

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.270
are marrying their princesses
at the same time.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.412
It is a nationwide celebration in Manbo.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.959
Wow, what a beautiful wedding.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.599
Yeah. Look at that.

00:08:18.075 --> 00:08:21.399
- Good.
- Good.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.039
(I never expected)

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.750
(my first wedding in life)

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:26.812
(to be filled with deals and deception.)

00:08:27.787 --> 00:08:28.986
(But at this moment,)

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.999
(I can truly feel the romance
of the wedding.)

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.199
(After fate played
so many tricks on me,)

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.390
(this is a small kindness
it has granted me.)

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.599
(Maybe the future
is full of uncertainty,)

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.479
(but at least in this moment,)

00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:45.062
(I want to fully enjoy
this brief happiness.)

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.359
The wedding ceremony officially begins.

00:10:02.937 --> 00:10:04.349
May you as husband and wife

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.957
live in love

00:10:08.812 --> 00:10:10.194
and loyalty.

00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:11.775
In times of happiness,

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.799
share with each other.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.175
When you face hardship,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.980
support one another.

00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:21.894
Uphold the duties of the royal family,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.450
and for the people,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.439
devote yourselves.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.710
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.719
This is a wedding gift
crafted by royal artisans

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.079
based on traditional designs,
especially made for you.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.079
May your love

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.199
be everlasting.

00:11:20.712 --> 00:11:23.031
I will bind you to me forever.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.519
What is wrong?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.519
I do not want to wear it.

00:11:40.012 --> 00:11:41.131
So many people are watching.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.525
You must wear it.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.112
Alright.

00:12:11.962 --> 00:12:13.925
On behalf of the people
of Manbo Kingdom,

00:12:16.412 --> 00:12:17.531
I bless you both

00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:20.209
to find true love for a lifetime.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.760
From this moment on,

00:12:22.812 --> 00:12:23.762
the two of you

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.000
are now officially

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.225
Princess Consorts.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.759
(So this is how romantic
and lavish a royal wedding is.)

00:13:11.337 --> 00:13:12.736
(The wine is already prepared.)

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.439
(Then I will just have a small sip.)

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.399
(It tastes pretty good.)

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.678
(It is my wedding today.)

00:13:19.678 --> 00:13:20.887
(Then bottoms up.)

00:13:27.737 --> 00:13:29.009
Hi, Qi.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.002
Look where I am.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:35.880
What are you doing?

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.450
Well,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.362
now that the wedding is over,

00:13:43.475 --> 00:13:44.994
I will head back first.

00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:45.961
Wait a moment.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.559
What is it?

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.919
We just got married.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.909
If you go back and sleep right away,

00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:56.787
it might raise suspicion.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.119
That makes sense.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.119
Mm.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.170
You are not going to make me
sleep on the couch, are you?

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:13.465
What else would I do?

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:16.575
What are you doing?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:17.787
I do not care.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.600
You have not showered yet.

00:14:18.612 --> 00:14:19.771
You are not allowed on my bed.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.750
- Guan Mengmeng, get down.
- I want to sleep on the bed.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.362
Do not touch my blanket.

00:14:24.362 --> 00:14:25.801
Get down, Guan Mengmeng.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.679
Good night.

00:14:26.787 --> 00:14:27.519
Get down.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.150
I will not.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.319
Song Pai.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.912
Ah.

00:14:34.962 --> 00:14:36.276
You are filthy.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.519
Get down here.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.439
Oh my God.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.119
Why are you so heavy?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.599
You are really too heavy.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.159
Put me down.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.737
Put me down.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.862
Sleep on

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.250
the

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.639
couch!

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.989
So heavy.
