00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.770
[Glory]

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.950
[Episode 6]

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.970
-Let's go take a look.
-Let's go.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.120
Let's go.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.680
I...

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.210
Let's go.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:46.840
Remember.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.509
Only pick the freshest bud heads.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.000
You must finish plucking one plant
in a single breath.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.870
Only by picking over 700 buds

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.840
within 10 minutes

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.229
can we deliver the goods in time at 5 PM.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.920
Got it.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.960
Just pluck it gently and don't pinch it!

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.500
Nor can you clutch it in your palm!

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.110
Don't touch that!

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.680
Mr. Wang!

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.630
You're quite cozy here.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.820
Look at those several fools.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.430
They don't know how to enjoy the pleasure.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.230
Have some tea.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.090
Okay.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.130
These playboys

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.470
have no idea
how hard tea farmers have to work.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.560
Even I only came to
the plantation this time

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.820
to check the accounts.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.350
But I've heard that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.060
the Pre-Qingming Tea here
is truly exceptional.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.970
Mr. Yang, won't you give it a try?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.310
It's like chicken eating fireflies.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.310
We both know what's really going on.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.400
Stop playing the tricks

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400
of brotherly respect in front of me.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.450
Young Masters, please learn carefully.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.270
Young Master!

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.280
Young Master.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.540
Lady Shanbao is appraising tea outside.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.110
Lady Shanbao is outside.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.870
Hurry up. Let's go.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.870
Come on. Let's go, too.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.630
Young Master, let's go.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.070
Wait for me!

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.600
Let's go.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.800
When I was a kid and saw my cousin
learning to fry tea leaves,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.160
I also cried and begged to learn it.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.360
But after less than half a month
of learning,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.000
my hands

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.560
were covered with 7 or 8 large blisters.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.040
My mother held me in her arms and cried.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.430
Then she didn't allow me
to go to the tea fields again.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.360
Now it looks like

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.040
learning to fry tea leaves
isn't that difficult after all.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.840
I'll go first.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.800
Young Master, when too many people
crowd around the hot stoves,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.240
you might scald your hands easily.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.800
Taking a different path
may bring unexpected joy.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.720
I won't learn it.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.310
You can learn it in place of me.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.310
I'm going to find my cousin now.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.360
You can learn it in place of me.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.390
No, Young Master.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.440
Sir.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.030
Could you let me give it a try?

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.360
This year's tea leaves

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.920
are indeed not as good as previous years.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.570
There has been too much rain
in the past few months.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.800
The tea leaves
have lost some of their aroma

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.200
and the flavor is weaker.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.220
Lady Shanbao.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.880
The tea merchants from Shanxi
have arrived.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.010
They're waiting for tea upstairs now.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.510
Got it.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.000
Every year before the Qingming Festival,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.950
the Rong family
would always hold a tea party.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.720
This year, I'd also like to taste the tea

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.870
which is made through you guys' skills.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.630
Skills?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880
Lady Shanbao, so you mean

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.950
you want us
to pick the tea leaves personally?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.560
Exactly.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.750
Pick and fry tea leaves personally.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.630
I see.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.140
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.720
Such rough work

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.000
is certainly beyond my abilities.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.040
Ask that tea picker
to demonstrate it again.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.430
We haven't seen it clearly yet.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.310
Lady Shanbao hired me to do this

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.600
with a large sum of money.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.000
I'm not your servant girl

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.320
to be ordered around!

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.430
-You...
-I explained it several times just now.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.750
If anyone doesn't understand,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.560
he might be

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.960
a blind and deaf villain.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.390
How... How dare you speak like that?

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.190
Lady Shanbao.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.800
There are quite many men in the village.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.390
They can
take care of children and work hard.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.190
There's a wide selection for you
to choose from.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.920
These are useless pretty boys.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.270
We can't let them work on this.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.480
Well... What does that mean?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.000
Your words are so offensive!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.950
-So offensive!
-So vulgar!

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.680
How could you talk like that?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.080
Yi is from the mountains.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.430
She speaks frankly without ill intent.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.159
Gentlemen, please don't mind.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.040
Yi.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.920
These young masters
are all exceptional men

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.250
and elites of our times.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.120
Such a simple matter as tea making,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.070
which you've explained repeatedly,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.390
certainly won't stump these smart people.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.070
They're

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.040
just saying this out of modesty.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.790
Don't take it too seriously.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.190
Shanbao, I...

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.480
The Rong family
treats all distinguished guests equally.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.490
Cousin, you're no exception, either.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.890
I'll wait for you all
at the tea party at 5 PM.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.630
Please excuse me now.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.280
Lady Shanbao! Lady Shanbao!

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.630
My cousin is so ruthless.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.640
Can't even I be an exception?

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.870
Young Masters, please.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.390
Let's go.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.120
Let's go.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.620
It's just picking and frying tea leaves.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.510
I don't think I'll be stumped.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.650
You've all tasted this year's tea.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.640
Later,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.870
I'll send some tea samples to your inns.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.950
Thank you.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.270
It's the same as previous years.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.159
I want 2000 jin.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.530
Lady Shanbao, you're back.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.310
It's been just a year,

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.560
and now you have a fine gentleman
by your side.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.000
It's rare that he knows
how to do business, too.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.460
He's quite helpful to you.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.870
You two are truly meant to be together.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.930
Congratulations!

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.430
Then we'll leave now.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.000
These merchants
travel all over the country.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.430
They speak and behave rudely.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.690
They were just joking.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.720
Young Master, please don't mind.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.380
Actually,
what they said isn't entirely wrong.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.620
Flowers attract butterflies,
and peacocks spread their tails.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.390
All these things I've done

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.480
are to show you

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.960
that I love tea
and know how to cultivate tea leaves.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.560
I also understand all aspects
of tea business.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.050
I'll be a good helper to you
in the future.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.160
You are truly diligent, Young Master.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.880
Business rewards honest people,
and Heaven rewards diligent people.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.080
I'll walk my own path,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.710
and I hope you'll also keep your promise

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.580
by giving me a fair chance.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.770
Fusheng.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.270
How did you know

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.670
Shanbao would set a test?

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.870
I didn't know.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.880
But I could guess it.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.390
As soon as the young masters
entered the tea plantation,

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.510
there was someone who meticulously

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.720
taught you guys how to make tea.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.390
If you had paid close attention,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.670
you would have noticed something was off.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.910
It's also because Shanbao is shrewd
and cunning.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.670
She suddenly stroke back
when we were off guard.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.480
If I had known earlier,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.210
I would have taken your advice.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.510
Look at those two men.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.270
Both their families own tea plantations.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.600
This test is so unfair.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.630
It's said that picking tea leaves is easy,
but frying tea leaves is hard.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.490
Think about it.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.510
Mr. Xu's hands are covered with scalds.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.240
That's how he became

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.670
skilled in frying tea leaves.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.800
Their hands look smooth and flawless.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.080
I don't think
they're much better than you.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.080
As long as you put more effort into it

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120
and don't slack off,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.980
Lady Shanbao will surely notice.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.080
If you really can't stand it,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.320
show your vulnerability when needed.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.920
Lady Shanbao
will be more concerned about you.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.390
Oh, no!

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.750
Mr. Bai fainted!

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.550
Yingsheng! Yingsheng!

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.610
Really? He fainted again?

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.320
Yingsheng!

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.730
-How are you?
-Yingsheng!

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:59.390
Are you alright?

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.750
Yingsheng, why did you pass out?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.630
They're just bullying honest people.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.760
He has to pluck such a large area alone.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.630
I'll go find a doctor. Step aside!

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.600
Step aside! Please step aside!

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.150
Mr. Wen.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.920
What's wrong?

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.650
He's usually not like this.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.870
I've told you this is

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.600
the work for servants.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.960
He usually doesn't do these things.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.160
How could he stand it?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.760
Why didn't Yan come here?

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.800
He only knows to exploit us.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:41.970
Darn it!

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.550
He must be exhausted.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.030
Hurry!
Carry him to the tree shade for a rest.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.270
Alright. Come on.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:47.910
Come on. Let me do it. Lift him up.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.170
Come on. Give me a hand.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.900
Be careful!

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.660
Come on.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.270
Come on.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.120
Sit.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.000
Here, Mr. Bai.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.250
Drink some tea.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.340
He should be fine, huh?

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.680
Where is Mr. Wen?

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.720
Are you alright, Mr. Bai?

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.150
He went that way.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.960
Mr. Yan.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.530
Please watch over everyone
in the tea fields for me.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.150
I trust you.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.400
Don't worry.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.270
Mr. Wen!

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.960
Mr. Wen!

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:58.960
Mr. Wen!

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.390
Mr. Wen! Mr. Wen!

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.480
Fusheng, my legs are injured.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.930
Ask Shanbao to come now!

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.830
Wait for me!

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.780
What happened?

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.360
Lady Shanbao, Mr. Wen is...

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.000
Shanbao! Shanbao!

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.750
I'm here!

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.670
Shanbao!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.650
Shanbao!

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.270
I think my legs are broken.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.320
Don't move.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.870
I'll ask people to come and save you.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.440
Don't go.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.080
Don't leave me alone

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.600
here.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.910
Could you stay here

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.840
and talk with me?

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.980
If you talk with me,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.710
it won't be that painful for me.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.600
Talking won't help to ease the pain.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.730
I think you should save your strength.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.420
Lady Shanbao,
please help me tie this tighter.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.420
I'll go down and carry him on my back.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.640
You're quite clever.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.900
The mountain paths
are steep and difficult to walk,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.150
but people's hearts
are even more unpredictable.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.000
I'm entrusted with your important task,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.260
so I must deal with everything properly.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.000
Be careful.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.010
Watch your step.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.250
Hang in there.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:00.710
Wen.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.390
Shanbao.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.280
I'll help Mr. Wen down the mountain first.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.680
You shameless scoundrel!

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.240
Where did you
get these ugly twigs and rotten leaves?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.080
Are you trying to muddle through
with these counterfeits?

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.870
How dare you ruin my tea plantation?

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.720
Even if
you were to offer me a lump of silver

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.390
or knee down and call me Grandmother,

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.140
I wouldn't acknowledge you as my grandson.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.140
-You...
-Guards.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.710
Take this troublemaker out.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.400
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.750
My father is the magistrate of Huaiyin!

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.170
You guys can't treat me like this!

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.890
Let go of me!

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.240
Which one?

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.790
The one who went to Huaiyin
to take office 5 years ago

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.430
and ran out of his travel money
while passing through Linji.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:07.270
Then he came to the Rong family

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.400
to borrow 500 taels.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.589
After all, he's an official's son,

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.589
so we should leave him some dignity.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.160
When your father saw Lady Shanbao,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.890
he knew he should show respect.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.020
How dare you behave so rudely here?

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.480
Take him out.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:23.740
Yes!

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.780
Let go of me! Let go of me!

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.490
Let go of me!

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.880
You guys can't treat me like this!

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.740
Hurry! Put him in the front first.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.920
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.550
How is he?

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.050
-Mr. Wen.
-Take a look.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.240
Besides his legs and arms,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.240
I'm afraid
he may have wounds in his brain, too.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.370
Take my cousin back home immediately.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.160
Hurry!

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.480
These people
went to the plantation normally.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.540
One of them fainted

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.190
and one of them fell down.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.310
Blood stained the tea plantation,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.720
which might damage the owner's good luck

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.650
and prosperity.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.920
They're all inauspicious people.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.000
This way, won't your chances of winning

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.960
become bigger?

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.110
Mr. Yang, you must be joking.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.000
The tea party will begin soon.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.110
Why are you still chattering?

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.710
Hurry up and make the tea now!

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.640
Alright.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.230
[Rong Mansion]

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.000
Oh, my son!

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.160
Can'er, oh, my dear Can'er!

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.920
Are you feeling better now?

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.790
Mother, why are you here?

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.160
What reason could it be?

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.810
Of course I'm here
to persuade you to go back.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.160
Please don't worry, Lady Shanbao.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.310
I'll just patiently persuade him

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.370
to change his mind.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.880
Guard the door properly.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.540
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.970
I won't go back.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.590
You came to the Rong family
without a word.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.750
If your father finds out about it,

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.000
he'll definitely break your legs!

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.750
It hurts, Mother!

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.350
I'm injured and you're still hitting me?

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.110
Let me take a look.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.030
I'm fine.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.390
You silly boy.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.720
But don't worry.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.750
All the letters from the Rong family

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.400
have been

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.460
intercepted by me.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.920
I didn't let your father
hear any news about it.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.850
Really, Mother?

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.830
Well, the boys
from the Yang family and the He family

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.560
are all here.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.590
How could our Wen family

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.920
fall behind the others?

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.270
You and Lady Shanbao

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.790
have been close since childhood,

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.270
with deep affection for each other.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.200
The Rong and Wen families

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.270
became sworn relatives

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.350
and often visit each other.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.440
If you two get married,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.640
it'll strengthen the bonds even further.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.960
It's such a wonderful thing
that can't even be achieved in dreams.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.400
It's all because
your father is pedantic and old-fashioned.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.960
He's afraid people will laugh at him

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.550
and think that he's selling his son.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.480
What an old fool.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.070
The Wen family doesn't have
millions-of-tales family property

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.030
to give to the son.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.440
This is a golden mountain in front of us.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.440
Mother, I don't care about
the Rong family's wealth.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:12.960
I just...

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.830
I know you have sincere feelings.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.030
But...

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.720
You have to beware of others
who have different intentions.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.640
The more kindly Lady Shanbao treats you,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.770
the more deeply others may resent you.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.550
They'll gang up to deal with you.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.070
You must

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.790
be careful
and pay attention to everything.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.640
Don't fall into

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.480
their traps.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.720
Bao

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.960
was brought up by her grandmother.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.130
She's wariest of

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.770
men with ulterior motives.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.920
The more aggressive and ruthless a man is,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.920
the more deeply
Shanbao will detest and beware of him.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.030
However, as for those who are guileless

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.310
and have fallen victim to others' plots,

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.640
Shanbao would be eagerer to protect them.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.720
Mother, don't worry.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.920
I understand

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.600
all these things very well.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.640
I'm injured.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.220
Why hasn't Shanbao come to see me yet?

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.040
Yuan Xiao.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.260
Where is my cousin?

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.000
Lady Shanbao...

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.540
Tell me now!

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.070
Where is my cousin?

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.600
Thank you for your concern, My Lady.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.670
I'm not injured.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.680
Oh, by the way,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.290
according to Mr. Wen,

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.550
an unfamiliar servant

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.720
lured him out

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.120
at the name of his father.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.750
He was afraid that his father

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.090
would make a scene,
which might be so embarrassing,

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.290
so he agreed to meet in a secluded place.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.640
But unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.310
that servant disappeared without a trace.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.970
He was ambushed by assassins.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.210
My cousin is kind-hearted

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.640
and easily falls victim to others' plots.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.270
Indeed.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.400
In the future, whether to take sea routes
to sell tea

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.750
or follow the caravans to travel
thousands of miles for tea trade,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.590
it's common
to encounter bandits and robbers.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.390
It's not easy to do tea business.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.160
Mr. Wen

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.280
still trusts others too easily.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.480
You're always concerned about others.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.740
Why don't you think more about yourself?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:26.830
Thank you.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.850
Thank you for your concern, My Lady.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.930
Since you joined the Rong family,

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.790
you've suffered many hardships

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.390
and got injured constantly.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.740
Could it be that

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.080
our destinies are incompatible by nature?

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.400
My Lady,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.590
please stop teasing me.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.070
Jun Dai.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:48.830
Here!

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.550
With your injuries,
it's quite inconvenient.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.070
Jun Dai,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.370
from today onwards,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.120
just stay here to serve him.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.220
Except for Steward Lu's orders,

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.720
you don't need to
follow anyone else's commands.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.240
Yes!

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.640
Steward Lu, let me apply medicine for you.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.400
Your ring is returned to you now.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.080
Lady Shanbao!

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.730
Steward Lu, you're so lucky.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.640
I've been a servant in the Rong family
since childhood,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.640
but I've never seen Lady Shanbao

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.960
be so attentive to anyone.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.440
It's obvious that in Lady Shanbao's mind,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.280
you're different from others.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.030
Really?

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.110
Yes.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.350
If I'm lying,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.480
just let lightning strike me to death.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.440
So this was also sent by Lady Shanbao?

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.030
Exactly.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.700
This is all top-quality
square-patterned Wu silk.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.030
You're so handsome

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.200
with graceful manner.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.110
Even those people in silk clothes

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.110
at the Xinfang Pavilion
can't compare with you.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.830
If you show up wearing these clothes,

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:09.720
no matter how hard
they try to flatter you,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.650
they still can't compare with you.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.340
Alright.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.660
Apply the medicine now.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.510
I wouldn't dare to delay dealing with

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.190
Lady Shanbao's important matters.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.830
Okay.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.450
How come
there aren't any February Orchids?

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.640
This area is only planted with some

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.470
valuable tea trees and flower varieties.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.620
No February Orchids
have ever been planted here.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.070
Yes, there were.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.160
They were some of them here before.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.160
I could smell them every day before.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:50.990
My Lady,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.000
February Orchids
are wildflowers from the countryside.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.680
How could they be worthy of
being planted in this garden?

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.210
Perhaps you were mistaken.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.260
Give it to me.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:03.960
A breeze

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.360
can bring its seeds here.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.240
Thousands of such flowers
can grow all over the hills.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.200
How would they be stopped by humans?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.130
Go find them now.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.880
I'll wait here.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Go now! I'm telling you to go now!

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.210
Yes! I'll go look for them now.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.970
Please wait here, My Lady.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.470
Mother, are there flowers here?

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.410
These are February Orchids.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.250
There's a whole field
of February Orchids here.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.970
Mother, I like February Orchids.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.430
Let me pick one for you.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.410
Our Yunshu is the most beautiful.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.870
Mother, my eyes

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.420
will never heal, will they?

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.020
They will heal.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.240
Once your father
asks your grandmother for help

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.680
and finds the best doctor in the world

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.740
to treat your eyes,

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.890
they will certainly be cured.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.550
Soon you'll move into

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.160
a very big house.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.770
There will be delicious food, fun toys

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.200
and your favorite

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.480
beautiful beaded flowers.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.340
There will be all of those things.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.110
Then from now on,

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.800
I won't wear these wildflowers anymore.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.600
I'm going to take you with me
to enjoy the good life.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.790
Miss, hold onto your cane.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:09.830
Let me help you up.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:11.850
It was right here.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.410
It was definitely right here.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:25.980
Wait for me.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.350
Miss, are you looking for this?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.420
L-Let me plant it back for you.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.520
Will it survive if we plant it back?

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.080
Yes, it will. I'm sure of it.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.330
Alright. It's done.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.390
Miss.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.850
Wait here for me.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.200
I'll go ask someone to come and help you.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.590
Lady Yunshu, I couldn't find it.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.110
Who are you?

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.880
I didn't know
you're Lady Yunshu from this mansion.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.900
Please forgive my ignorance and offense.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.100
I don't dare to disturb you any further.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.680
I'm Bai, and I'll leave now.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.200
Your surname is Bai?

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:29.790
Are you the scholar

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.920
who fainted in the martial arts arena?

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.580
I'm not skilled in martial arts.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.070
I'm sorry for my poor performance.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.680
Hiding skill in clumsiness
and using retreat to advance.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.960
You are a smart man.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.880
Later, at the tea party,

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.750
remember this.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.130
Drink more tea and speak less.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.470
Drink more tea and speak less.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.440
What does that mean?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.580
Bai Yingsheng.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.590
You fainted even while picking tea leaves.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.480
Your health

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.920
is just too fragile.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.000
I thought

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.270
you couldn't make it to this tea party.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.600
I was about to send someone
to check on you.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.410
Thank you for your concern.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.110
I was also afraid I couldn't make it.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.830
Thankfully, Lady Shanbao was kind enough

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.160
to let me use the small tea room
in her mansion,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.620
so I barely made it in time.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.880
I wonder
what funny scenes we'll see today.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.680
Mr. Bai.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:54.400
My master

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400
heard that you were feeling unwell,

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.310
so he specially ordered me

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.970
to bring you these Suhe Pills.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.350
Take the pills with warm wine.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.210
They can help to regulate your organs,
harmonize your Qi and blood,

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.350
and dispel impurities to calm your nerves.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.150
They can assist you
in restoring your health.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.310
Mr. Yan is so kind that I can't refuse.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.520
We were all sweating profusely

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.780
in the tea plantation,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.030
but we didn't see Mr. Yan

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.410
go there to pick tea leaves.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.600
Now it's time
for inspecting the tea in public.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.930
Don't flinch in the face of the challenge.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.440
The distinguished guests of Chongxi Hall

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.830
can pass the test without making tea.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.960
They're 100 times better than us.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.310
You still need to
beware of their duplicity

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.350
as they might speak ill of you
in front of Old Madam Rong

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.210
to make you have nowhere to stand.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.140
Just try to speak less.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.000
You...

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.590
We're just going to taste tea.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.920
These guys keep talking so sarcastically.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.850
If they're taken to a private room,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.620
they would be so annoying.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.640
While men are competing out of jealousy,

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.510
they would
show their ugly sides inevitably.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.240
It's irritating to watch this.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.310
That's why Yun'e used the pretext
of being ill.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.170
Xiangling isn't coming, either.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.880
But Grandmother thinks that's not enough.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.200
She's even ordering each branch
of the family

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.000
to select new candidates again.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.790
There will be quite a spectacle
in the Rong Mansion.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.110
Lady Shanbao is here!

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.920
Some of you are older than me.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.400
I shouldn't be receiving such bows.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400
Old Madam Rong is highly respected.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.880
You're hosting the banquet
on behalf of her.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.590
You're certainly supposed to
take the chief seat

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.790
and receive our bows.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.230
No need for such modesty.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.350
Yes, indeed.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.000
That makes sense.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.400
Yes.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.830
Only after you take the chief seat

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.160
will we dare to sit down.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.600
Everyone, please sit down.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.110
Since you're hosting this banquet,

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.560
then I'd like to
be in charge of the music.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.370
Forgive me if there's anything

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.920
I've overlooked.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.510
Play the music!

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.679
Young Master.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.670
Young Master, what's wrong?

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:28.659
I... I killed a constable.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:30.429
Did I...

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.460
Huishan Spring Water! That's good stuff!

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.480
These are the processed tea leaves

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.230
the young masters personally

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.090
made in the tea plantation today.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.139
The spring water also arrived yesterday.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.340
It's fresh and sweet,

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.070
which is perfect for brewing tea.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.600
Everyone, please taste it.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.480
Good water! It's so refreshing!

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:20.320
As the saying goes, it's clear enough
to reflect flesh and bones,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.550
and gargling with it
can help to revitalize the mind.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.760
This Huishan Spring Water

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.670
is truly divine nectar
in the mortal world.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.800
It's clearly almost the same as usual.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.030
Perhaps there's something wrong
with my taste buds.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.630
No wonder people always say,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.590
"Taking the world's 2nd-best spring water

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.590
to brew wine and drinking it
with immortals in Heaven."

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.110
Now that we have this water to brew tea,

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.230
how could there be

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.770
anything wrong with it?

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.840
It's all thanks to
Lady Shanbao's great luck,

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.120
so we can taste this fine spring water.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.250
We should thank Lady Shanbao for that.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.670
Later, at the tea party,

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.530
remember this.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.740
Drink more tea and speak less.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.550
How pretentious and hypocritical!

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:02.630
The Huishan Spring Water

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.320
was all distributed
as soon as it arrived that month.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.160
The maid only said it arrived yesterday.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.270
Has she ever mentioned
this is Huishan Spring Water?

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.630
The jar
just contains ordinary spring water.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.840
You're just like
half-green radishes in June.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.000
You all have made such exaggerated claims.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.930
How ridiculous!

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.050
The color is uneven and lackluster.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.920
It's the lowest grade.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.840
The color is sallow with ashen tones.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.690
It's the inferior grade.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.510
There are scorch marks.
It's the inferior grade.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.880
Stems and veins are exposed.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.960
The ratio is out of balance.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.590
It's the inferior grade.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:18.230
It's the inferior grade.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.110
It's the lowest grade.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.510
It's the inferior grade.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.610
It's greenish-yellow with poor luster.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.080
But it's barely acceptable.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.020
It's the medium grade.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:50.990
You can stay.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.730
The color is bright green
with even shapes and tender textures.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.900
It's the top grade.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.530
Thanks for your compliments, Lady Shanbao.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.800
Mr. Yan didn't go to the tea fields,

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.730
and that's fine.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.660
But the He family

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.380
is the manufacturer of Huqiu Tea.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.190
Lady Shanbao.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.840
How do you expect all of us

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.990
to accept this?

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.400
-That's right!
-That's right!

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.400
It's unfair!

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.280
How can we compete like this?

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.320
Yes, it's unfair!

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.240
That's right!

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:50.620
The flavor is ordinary,

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.880
but fortunately, it doesn't
have the smell of coarse impurities.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.510
It's also the medium grade tea.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.710
Let them take a look.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.540
I know little about tea.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.630
I've learned this from the tea woman

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.960
in the Fangyuan Temple.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.690
I learned it for three months,

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.840
but I only acquired a smattering of it.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.320
That's just it.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.840
When scholars enter the examination hall,

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.360
some of them
don't understand poetry or classics,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.420
and some of them
didn't bring brush pens and inkstones.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.360
My family runs tea business.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.660
Knowing nothing about making tea,
you're here to participate in the test.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.710
How could you show your sincerity
in the marriage proposal?

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.090
I asked you to go into the plantation

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:26.880
because I wanted to give you guys

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.510
a chance to make up for your mistakes.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.310
Yet you still didn't cherish it.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.320
Moreover,

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.020
Mr. Yan practiced for years on Mount Meng

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.800
and has mastered all tea arts
in the world.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.810
Lady Shanbao
didn't ask him to enter the plantation

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.340
not because of favoritism,

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.780
but to spare you all from embarrassment.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.880
Since you're
almost completely enlightened,

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.630
after entering the tea plantation,

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.550
you should have been more attentive.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.920
As for the early-spring fresh tea leaves
from my family,

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.060
even if they had not been dried or fried

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.110
and had just been cooked in the pot,

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.320
it would still be the top grade.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.000
When you were frying the tea leaves,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.880
there were tea-making masters

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.340
teaching you step by step.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.400
Even with such a demonstration,

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.660
you still messed it up.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.650
You guys keep playing tricks
and slacking off

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.180
and only excel in flattery.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.490
The Rong family doesn't lack yes-men.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.880
Get out of here now!

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.880
-How could you talk like that?
-What do you mean?

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.140
They're still our guests. Don't be rude.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:11.960
As for the young masters
who got the low grade,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.800
we've prepared small gifts

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.760
in the room.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.240
There will be carriages
taking you to the dock.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.700
The Rong family
will not detain you further.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.330
Let's go.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.150
Let's go.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.200
Let's go.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.920
The selected candidates
for this round are...

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:29.900
Mr. Yang,

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.440
Mr. He

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.710
and Mr. Bai.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:35.670
Lady Shanbao.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.560
There is still some tea
you haven't tasted yet.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.360
Who is he?

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840
He's Steward Lu.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.880
It looks like
I didn't have a discerning eye.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.800
I thought this man was quite ugly.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.470
Now that he has dressed up like this,

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.000
he actually looks quite presentable.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.330
Who do you think you are?

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.370
How dare you also serve tea here?

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.710
Before leaving the mountain,
Mr. Wen repeatedly asked me to do this.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.670
He ordered me to prepare the tea
according to his instructions.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.070
Now he is seriously injured and bedridden,

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.110
so I have to present the tea
on his behalf.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.910
Lady Shanbao.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:22.200
Please.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.950
It was overcooked a bit,
but it's still the top grade.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.590
Since it was overcooked,

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.160
how can it be rated as the top grade?

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.130
It has the common orchid-bean fragrance.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.810
It seems fresh from the pot.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:52.440
There's the dry scent of fire.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.590
There is indeed a unique roasted aroma.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.620
What did you do to the tea leaves?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.000
I...

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:05.960
Mr. Wen

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:07.920
noticed that the tea leaves had moisture,

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.800
probably because of

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.960
the recent rainy days.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.300
He specifically asked me
to roast the tea leaves again

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.360
after frying them.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.800
However, the young masters
left too hurriedly

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.600
and too early,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.440
so they didn't hear

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.100
Mr. Xu's tea-making secrets.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.430
That's right.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.980
Look. Pay attention to this technique.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.840
Do it like this.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.710
Look.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.800
I'm impressed by your thorough thinking.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.800
You truly have a gift for making tea.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.150
It's all thanks to the guidance
of the experienced tea master.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.880
I don't dare to take any credit.

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:51.960
Alright.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.640
Plus Mr. Wen,

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.880
the number is enough for the Mahjong game.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880
They're all talented men.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.550
Yet we must select just one
from these five men.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:59.030
Even I think

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.360
this is a tricky problem for you, Shanbao.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.560
There are not only five men.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.080
I think there are six men.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.410
The Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony
will be held in seven days.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:20.480
The Rong family sincerely invites
all young masters to attend.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.100
Stop right there!

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.280
Ms. Yan.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:45.290
The Rong family
has set rules for everything.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.420
Everyone must strictly follow these rules.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.000
What kind of occasion
do you think the tea party is?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.160
You can't go there.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.920
I don't dare to disobey the rules

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920
set by you.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.310
But marking the boat
won't help to find a lost sword.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.360
Rules must also adapt to
changing circumstances.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.030
Sometimes, to complete our tasks properly,

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:01.280
servants like us

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.320
have to add salt when the flavor is bland

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.850
or reduce the heat when it boils over.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:05.920
We don't always have the time

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.520
to report everything to you.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.590
Please forgive me, Ma'am.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.990
How dare you talk so much?

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:12.150
Who gave you the guts

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.210
to be so disrespectful in front of me?

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.500
I gave him the guts.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.740
[Tea Leaf Picking Skills]

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.200
Just pluck it gently and don't pinch it!

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.640
Nor can you clutch it in your palm!

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.480
During the Ming Dynasty,
there were already strict standards

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.190
for high-class tea leaf harvesting,

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.840
especially for tribute tea leaves,

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.700
which are premium tea leaves
classified by grades.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:10.290
Take only one bud with one leaf

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.230
or one bud with two newly unfurled leaves.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:13.490
The length of the bud head must

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:14.820
exceed the leaf length.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:15.100
The bud must be longer than the leaf.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.050
[Single Bud: The highest picking standard
with the highest tenderness.]

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.050
[It's usually used to
make top green tea, white tea, etc.]

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.080
As for the first-grade tea,

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.620
it mainly consists of one bud
with one or two newly unfurled leaves.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:21.840
The bud must be as long as the leaf.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.010
[One Bud and One Leaf:
The classic top-quality grade]

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:22.500
[It balances the freshness and fragrance.]

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:23.210
[It's widely used for
high-class green tea, yellow tea, etc.]

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:23.400
[One Bud and Two Leaves:
The taste is usually mellower.]

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:23.750
There are strict requirements
for the appearance, too.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:24.680
[It's the top-grade ingredient
of many types of black tea.]

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.260
Buds and leaves
must be intact with even shapes

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:27.970
and no damage.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:29.390
There mustn't be any mature leaves,

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:31.990
tea stems or non-tea impurities
mixed in them.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.110
The picking techniques
also require special attention.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.280
When you pick tea leaves,
the palm should face down,

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.360
with your thumb and index finger
forming the shape of a pincer.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.610
Precisely grip the base
of the tender stem.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.670
Gently pull it upward to break it off.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.510
Avoid damaging it with fingernails.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.600
Once you pick the buds and leaves,

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.450
put them
into the ventilated bamboo basket at once.

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.620
Avoiding compression
from being held in hand.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.890
Tea leaf pickers
need to undergo rigorous training.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.970
Only a few jin of fresh leaves
can be acquired every day.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.550
Under this strict selection system,

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.580
Ming Dynasty's famous tea leaves
were created

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.690
to be as green as jade

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.480
and have fragrance like orchids.
