=Light of Dawn=

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.622
Why did you hide it from me?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.920
Say something.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.840
Is it fun playing me?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.960
Feifei, don't blame your dad.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.870
I was worried

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.960
you couldn't handle this.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.190
That's why I followed you quietly.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.190
You do whatever
my dad asks, right, Uncle Ming?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.000
Your dad placed her in this hospital

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.222
because he feared she'd cause
trouble after waking up.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.360
The director here

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.030
is also from the group.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.630
We're old friends.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.680
It's easier to handle things this way.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.910
We took care of the people
around Wang Dan,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.120
and settled all her issues.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.150
We only wanted to give you
the best wedding.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.870
It's for my own good?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.870
So treating me like a fool
is for my good?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.120
Feifei.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.840
Your dad did everything for you.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.840
Talk to him properly.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.190
You recognize
Wang Dan's handwriting, right?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.470
Less than a month ago,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.680
you told Wang Dan you'd stop seeing her.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.710
She came to see Feifei and me once.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.430
She wrote this guarantee letter,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.800
saying she'd leave Binchuan
after getting the money.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.190
When they met,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.150
the two of them argued a bit.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.630
Wang Dan's phone got smashed.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.400
That silly girl

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.360
secretly

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.240
took the phone back.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.840
She thought after fixing it,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.400
she could snoop through your chats.

00:03:44.955 --> 00:03:47.030
- Then what about her?
- Someone like her...

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.870
Once she got the money,
she definitely left.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.400
Everything's been taken care of.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.280
What more do you want?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.960
Nothing.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.630
Alright.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.520
Now that outsiders are done,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.360
let's talk about family matters.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.190
Yang, how have we treated you?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.360
How do you see this family?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.870
You've treated me very well.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.240
Honestly?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.390
Honestly.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.000
And you?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.270
Are you still holding
something back from us?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.720
As Liu Bin and the others said,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.600
all these years,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.430
you've been the signboard,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.270
and I'm Cao Mengde.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.310
No matter how careful I am,

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.870
no matter how sensible you are,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.750
there will still be gossip.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160
There will always be barriers.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.600
Otherwise,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.870
one woman couldn't cause such trouble.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.920
Uncle, please stop.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:04:58.720
This was my fault.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.830
What uncle?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.480
Call me Dad.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.390
When I do things,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.510
I always look at the essence.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.800
Everything else is unimportant.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.920
Understood.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.560
I'll ask Lawyer Cao
to transfer the shares back.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.070
No.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.240
You still haven't grasped
the essence.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.120
Do you really think

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.120
I forced you to marry

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.390
just for Zhao Qiang's shares?

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.430
You've got it wrong.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.430
I should thank this share incident.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.390
It finally allowed you
to get married.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.360
That's what I've always hoped for.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.870
Keep the shares.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.750
In the family and in the group,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.430
you'll have more say.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.160
Yang, you're a good kid.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.950
You two grew up together.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.390
Childhood sweethearts.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.830
There's deep affection between you.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.120
Money can be handled.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.270
Political and business ties
can be handled.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.920
Men's little problems
can be handled, too.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.360
Our family's principle is

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.040
morality,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.630
and feelings.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.480
Yang.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.680
Do you love Feifei?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.040
I do.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.680
Feifei.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.750
Do you love Yang?

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.120
Come, give me your hand.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.040
That's more like it.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.240
From now on, the two of you

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.310
must stop being petty.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.000
As a husband, be caring.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.480
As a wife,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.240
be tolerant.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.000
Live well together.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.620
(Xu Zhiyang, Wu Feifei)

=Episode 4=
=The Wedding=

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.480
Do you even know

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.390
how dangerous it is
to fall down the stairs?

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.390
She was lucky to be injured.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.000
What if she'd died?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.190
That would've been huge.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.120
Look at that gloomy face.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.120
If you keep sulking,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.240
bad luck will chase you down.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.270
If I were you,

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.720
I'd go find a temple to pray.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720
Light some incense.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.310
Would it kill you to tell me?

00:07:37.488 --> 00:07:38.310
This is training me?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.270
Not just training,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.430
but also teaching you a lesson.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.560
So that in the future,

00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:47.600
you won't try to do everything alone.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.750
Got it.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.040
Wu,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.000
do you know why I push myself so hard?

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.830
Why?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.870
(I never told Wu this.)

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.040
(There's always been
a barrier between us.)

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.830
(We rarely talk about my mother.)

00:08:20.022 --> 00:08:21.240
(My mom's name was Li Hongyue.)

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.240
(In my third year of life,)

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.510
(she died from postpartum depression.)

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.390
(Wu built a small study for her.)

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.240
(I asked Uncle Ming)

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.600
(and many others.)

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.960
(They said)

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.480
(my mom was a key contributor
at the start of the group.)

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.480
(She was a legend in this city.)

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.840
(Someone who could get anything done.)

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720
(But to me,)

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.670
(apart from the name Hongyue,)

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.480
(my mom left nothing behind.)

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.120
(Every Thursday night,)

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.088
(Wu would hide in that
small room listening to songs.)

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.480
(Songs my mom sang.)

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720
(He never allowed)

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.910
(anyone to enter that room.)

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.200
(I went in when I was little.)

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.120
(Later, for Wu's sake,)

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.000
(I stopped going.)

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.360
(But I vaguely remember)

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.240
(my mom once said)

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.440
(when you feel lonely,)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.630
(go listen to the voice
inside the statue.)

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.790
♪It can never be three people♪

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.150
♪You can go find a new love♪

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.430
♪Or disappear without a word♪

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.400
♪But don't use repayment as an excuse♪

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.460
♪To hurt me again♪

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.270
If only she were still here.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.510
She could've witnessed
your beautiful moment.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.360
The burden on your shoulders
is getting heavier.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.240
Our generation broke through

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.080
with courage and strategy.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.790
It's easy to conquer,
and hard to defend.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.670
But I believe in you.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.910
Because you carry my blood,

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.790
and your strong mother's too.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.630
I promised your mother

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.480
to marry our princess off

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.270
with dignity and happiness.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.550
People like us getting married

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.790
is also a show for others.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.550
Since no one's around,

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.510
make a wish.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.440
(Just like every birthday,)

00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:36.150
(this time, getting married,)

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.000
(I made the same wish.)

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.670
(That Wu would age slower,)

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:41.960
(and I)

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.080
(would grow up faster.)

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.510
As for the wedding, keep it small.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.320
Low-key.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.390
Our old friends and former leaders

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.670
can have a few tables in private rooms.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.960
Leave the main hall to the young people.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.840
Watch the media.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.240
They must not be invited or allowed in.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.080
The lower the profile, the better.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320
All these things

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.720
are handled by Feifei herself.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.030
Feifei has grown up.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.870
She can handle it.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.630
While we still can,

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.960
let's help more.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.390
When we can't help anymore,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.390
then it's up to their own fate.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
(Welcome to our wedding;
Mr. Xu & Ms. Wu)

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.600
Yes.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.600
Penglai Plaza is a project of
our Penglai Group.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.270
Miss Wu, do you recognize her?

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.360
On October 9, this woman drove

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.790
into the stone lion at Penglai Plaza.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.870
She died on the spot.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.000
(Everyone thinks I'm a happy person.)

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.670
(Only one close friend)

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.270
(cut straight to the point
and said I was lonely.)

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.510
(Best Friend)

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.288
(I told her she was talking nonsense.)

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.000
(Until this moment before my wedding,)

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.630
(did I realize)

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.080
(my best friend was right.)

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.200
I'm getting married.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.510
Should I go?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.600
At a time like this, I only call you.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.550
I just want to hear what you think.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.960
Can you treat this like a coin toss

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.030
and say something to me?

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.790
(I thought)

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.630
(I'd separated benefit
and feelings clearly.)

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.910
(Facing this mess,)

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.960
(I suddenly hesitated.)

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.150
Wu.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.120
Proceed with the wedding.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.150
Let's talk.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.240
Don't wait till the police find out.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.080
The whole family is still in the dark.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.200
Didn't Wang Dan leave?

00:16:10.066 --> 00:16:11.422
Why did you hide it from me?

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.320
Yang.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.550
Sit.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.120
What we said

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.200
doesn't quite match the reality.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.000
This is my fault.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.120
I didn't handle it well.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.200
Zhiyang.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.270
A few days before the wedding,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.360
Wang Dan went to see Feifei.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.270
The talk went badly.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.870
It ended in a conflict.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.870
Wang Dan fell.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.120
She's been unconscious since.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.270
I later went to Wang Dan's place

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.390
to smooth things over.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.840
This is what I found

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.790
under her bed.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.030
Intimate photos of you and Wang Dan.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.270
More importantly, a law book.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.400
She wanted revenge.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.830
I was careless, too.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.720
I didn't expect her to wake up.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.750
That's how all this happened.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.590
Uncle Ming,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.640
burn all of it.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.270
Yes, Mr. Wu.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.510
That's not right.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.830
Even if it was revenge,

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.880
she should've come here.

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.830
Why did she go to the square?

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.400
There's something

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.110
we never told you.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.830
We didn't want to upset you.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.680
That shove

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.440
caused Wang Dan to lose a child.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.880
To save her life,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.400
the doctors removed her uterus.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.880
What?

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.270
Think about the timing.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.000
It shouldn't be yours.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.070
Something this serious,

00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:53.960
and we still let them

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.350
celebrate the wedding here.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.240
That's a separate matter.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.790
For families like theirs,
a wedding is about face.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.510
They invested heavily in it.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.200
Besides, you have no evidence.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.920
Who are you to stop them?

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.960
But...

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.880
Here's a trick.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.750
If you want to find something,

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.640
don't provoke hostility

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.110
right from the start.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.400
A crash at the square.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.720
A body hidden under a statue.

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.400
These are all murder cases.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.880
The police will figure it out.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.240
But

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.310
Wang Dan's injuries can't be hidden.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.880
Everyone could get dragged in.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.960
Instead of three people,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.110
better just one.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.510
Besides, Wang Dan's case isn't that big.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.270
At most, it's an accidental injury.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.510
I'll go.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.590
Go where?

00:18:44.622 --> 00:18:45.960
What does it have to do with you?

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.480
You just got discharged.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.270
Today is your wedding day.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.590
Yang.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.350
Take care of Feifei.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480
Take care of the family.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.070
Lawyer Cao and his team
will come up later

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.550
to train you both.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.110
They'll teach you what to do,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.000
what to say,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.590
and how to put the blame on me.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.680
I'll go.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.000
Dad.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.400
Let me go.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.200
You can't.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.590
I know police procedures.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.350
All three of us will be questioned.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.510
I know.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.750
But this started because of me.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.110
I should go.

00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:31.200
Besides, Wang Dan
isn't the focus anymore.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.400
This is clearly aimed at our group.

00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:35.030
There's a body in the statue.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.160
It could also be aimed
at my father, Xu Peng.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.310
No matter who it's aimed at,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.160
I should go.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.400
How is it? Does this outfit work?

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.030
It doesn't look forced.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.880
Don't worry. Go in and stall for time.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.550
My dad and I will find out

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.000
what's going on with the bones.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.720
We just got married,
and are already separating again.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.510
Don't act on emotion.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.310
Think everything through before acting.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.240
Keep a clear head, understand?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.510
Okay.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.550
I'm going.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.550
Big Dog.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.270
Take care of yourself.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.070
You too.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.270
He won't look back.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.030
He's been trained for this.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.880
That's important.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.480
I know.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.480
Yang got guts.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.590
Stronger than his dad.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:42.380
(Xu Zhiyang, Wu Feifei)

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.880
I've said everything I need to.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.400
Do you know what kind of punishment

00:21:51.466 --> 00:21:52.680
your husband will face?

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.750
Xu Zhiyang,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.350
apart from the accidental injury

00:22:00.377 --> 00:22:02.133
and medical interference he admitted to,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.440
what's the deal with the bones
in the statue?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.440
What will happen to Xu Zhiyang?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.577
What will happen to my husband?

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.240
Say something!

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.160
Calm down first.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.200
Alright.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.200
Let's pause here.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.790
Go out and rest for a bit.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.720
Feifei,

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.400
it's actually very simple.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.590
Just remember two things.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.550
First,

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.270
everything you did

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.480
was out of concern for your husband.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.880
Second,

00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:42.160
when you don't want to talk anymore
or can't continue,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.960
you cry.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.750
Emotion is a woman's best weapon.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.960
We'll handle the rest.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.830
Come in.

00:23:15.533 --> 00:23:16.888
It's all taken care of?

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.820
(People's Police)

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.100
(Municipal Public Security Bureau)

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:49.220
(Binchuan Police)

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.780
(Binchuan Detention Center 194)

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.350
According to Xu Zhiyang's statement,

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.030
he argued with Wang Dan,

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:01.790
hit her,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.310
causing her serious injury and coma.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.310
He then restrained Wang Dan

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.550
and had her uterus removed.

00:24:06.733 --> 00:24:08.590
After waking up,
Wang Dan planned revenge,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.920
crashing the bones out.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.160
But Mr. Wu,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.590
there's something I don't understand.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.590
May I ask you?

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.750
If Wang Dan wanted revenge
on Xu Zhiyang,

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.480
why didn't she crash the wedding venue?

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.750
Why did she crash into
the stone lion statue

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.110
at Penglai Square instead

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.030
and uncover
a pile of bones?

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.750
And how did she even know

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.350
there were bones
hidden inside the statue?

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:32.270
That's what I want to know too,
Captain Meng.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.200
That question should be
asked of Xu Zhiyang.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.550
Zhiyang,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.270
you shifted the focus
using an emotional dispute.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.920
We'll use these few days

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.480
to trace the origin of the bones
and Wang Dan's motive,

00:24:46.533 --> 00:24:47.555
come up with a plan,

00:24:47.577 --> 00:24:49.088
and get you out as soon as possible.

00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:50.920
I've said everything I need to.

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:52.777
I've owned up to Wang Dan's case.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.240
At most,
it's an emotional dispute to me.

00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:57.355
Did you know
there was a body in the statue?

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.590
How could I possibly know?

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.480
Your father built the square,

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.270
Xu Peng.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.310
Then dig him up

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.880
and ask him.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.790
I don't know.

00:25:04.355 --> 00:25:05.680
We investigated the background

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.640
behind your daughter's sudden marriage

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.030
and found it tied
to the history of Penglai Group.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.310
All these years,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.400
on the surface,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.400
you were in charge
of the group's operations,

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.480
but in reality,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.790
the real power was still
with Xu Peng and his son.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.920
Now that the group is in trouble,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.000
you knew very well

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
about Xu Zhiyang's private life issues,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.920
yet you still chose

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.790
to marry your only daughter to him.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.830
I want to know,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.790
as a father,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.680
what were you thinking?

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.830
What do you mean?

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.480
Are you saying

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.960
there was bad blood
between them in the past,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.000
so my father is taking revenge
on the Xu family now?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.310
I've watched Yang grow up
since he was a child.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.160
Whether he married Feifei or not,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.830
I see it as his personal matter.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.200
And our family matter.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.110
What exactly is inside the statue
at Penglai Square...

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.960
I honestly don't know.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.240
Are you sure you don't know?

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.200
If I did, I'd tell Wang Dan?

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.680
Even if I knew,

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.310
shouldn't I immediately

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.270
dispose of the body?

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.400
Would I just wait for this to blow up?

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:10.400
Would I wait for a
ticking time bomb to go off?

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.000
These past few days,
after your husband surrendered,

00:26:13.111 --> 00:26:14.933
what have you
and your dad been doing?

00:26:14.933 --> 00:26:17.030
The heir of Penglai Group
was taken by the police

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.550
in front of everyone at the wedding.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.440
Binchuan is a small place,
and rumors spread fast.

00:26:21.911 --> 00:26:24.270
We have to spend some effort
to handle these things.

00:26:24.311 --> 00:26:26.080
What about your house manager,
Zhao Tianming?

00:26:26.133 --> 00:26:26.960
Is he important?

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.110
Through our investigation these days,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.550
Zhao Tianming hasn't been
to the company office,

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.640
nor handled Penglai Plaza's documents.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.955
He went to the hospital instead.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.790
Where Wang Dan was hospitalized.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.110
He tried to delete a piece of
surveillance footage.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.920
I'm just a simple, honest businessman.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.440
Working for employees,

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.000
working for the company,

00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:53.510
and working for society.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.550
Penglai is what it is today

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.720
because it came at the right time.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.640
We should thank this era.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.550
I heard your dad recently

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.720
had a sudden fainting episode.

00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:04.240
It's from diabetes complications.

00:27:04.577 --> 00:27:06.110
What does this have to do with Wang Dan?

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.960
On the surface, nothing.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.110
But

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.920
your dad was faking
this fainting episode.

00:27:14.377 --> 00:27:16.422
Your dad was pretending to be sick.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.000
Do you know?

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.940
(Medical record)

00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:53.688
The twice-cooked pork
with pickled vegetables is ready.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.070
(Chen's Food Stall)
Can I discuss something with you?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.920
The boss's daughter
really loves this dish.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.880
But she's in a hurry today.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.044
I'm afraid we won't have time.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.070
So I want to swap something with you.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.240
This is the extra
braised pork intestines I bought.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.480
Okay.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.310
Sir, I...

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.880
If I were you, I wouldn't rush back

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.355
before handling the boss's matters.

00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:36.830
Give the father and daughter
some private space to talk.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.790
Don't worry.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.070
My people will deliver the meal for you.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.830
Miss Wu.

00:28:45.955 --> 00:28:47.755
Uncle Ming was delayed by something.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.790
We are nearby.

00:28:54.044 --> 00:28:55.310
If you want to talk, anytime.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.070
Give me your phone.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.240
Wait a moment.

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:15.444
You know about
the body in the statue, right?

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.240
Some matters

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.160
are too deep.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.920
I discussed with Zhiyang.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.830
You'd better not know.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.880
Why can't I know?

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.440
We'll handle these
messy matters ourselves.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.590
Things have reached this point.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.480
I must know the truth.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.750
The body in the statue

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.310
was a worker's relative.

00:29:49.644 --> 00:29:52.030
She happened to have
an accident at the construction site,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.960
and was hit on the head by a stone.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.270
At that time,
the company was just starting.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.480
Your Uncle Xu

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.350
borrowed a huge amount of
high-interest loans.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.400
If this incident had blown up,

00:30:03.111 --> 00:30:04.644
the company would have collapsed.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.830
So your Uncle Xu

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.240
kept it from everyone.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.960
He gave the workers a day off.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.030
He handled it all by himself.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.830
Did you know about this at the time?

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.590
No, I only found out recently.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.310
That was a human life, Dad.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.240
You didn't experience those things.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.070
Your Uncle Xu and I

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.350
had no background,

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.590
just pushed forward
by people and events.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.640
No turning back.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:46.720
- Question.
- Answer.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.750
Wu Guohao still hasn't made a move.

00:30:48.777 --> 00:30:49.844
What does that indicate?

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.960
I really don't understand him.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.550
There's one possibility.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.440
Wang Dan's car accident
is related to Wu Guohao.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.510
He's hiding it from Wu Feifei.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.070
Then why didn't you tell me

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.200
about Wang Dan waking up?

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.070
She woke up two days

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.880
before your wedding.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.590
She made some demands.

00:31:07.829 --> 00:31:09.269
Outrageous demands.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.131
If I told you about this,

00:31:12.655 --> 00:31:14.629
how could you still get married?

00:31:16.497 --> 00:31:17.897
Let's talk about serious matters.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.680
What else did the police say to you?

00:31:25.355 --> 00:31:26.955
Why did you pretend to be sick?

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.790
You believe what the police said?

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.200
They were bluffing you.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.400
The most urgent thing,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.440
is who is the person
who knew the location

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.830
of the body and instructed Wang Dan

00:31:40.022 --> 00:31:41.244
to carry out the collision?

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.790
What's his motive?

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.350
Where is he?

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.750
We're completely in the dark.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.240
Master, I'm so hungry.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.480
Being hungry is good.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:02.960
Keeps you sharp.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.070
Didn't you always say

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.200
you need to eat well to work hard?

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.400
That's a different matter.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.270
Keep watch. I'll rest a bit.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.070
This will take a while,

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.270
especially between
a father and daughter.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.640
Wake me in half an hour.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200
Okay.

would I have waited twenty years?

You want to ask me?

and you can truly protect Mr. Wu

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.400
and save Penglai Group.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.190
Give me some time, okay?

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.280
If my dad really has a problem,

00:35:22.311 --> 00:35:24.711
I'll send him to cooperate
with the investigation.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.670
Dad, I went to the police.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:03.550
I want to show you a video.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.840
It's before Yang was taken away.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.030
Our training with him.

00:36:07.266 --> 00:36:09.000
Once you watch it, you'll understand.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.400
(I broke up with Wang Dan,)

00:36:12.622 --> 00:36:13.622
(but she refused.)

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.110
(Then we argued.)

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:16.711
(She tried to hit me,)

00:36:16.777 --> 00:36:19.044
(so I accidentally
pushed her down the stairs.)

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.030
(She passed out.)

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.000
(What else do you know)

00:36:22.044 --> 00:36:23.355
(about the bones in the statue?)

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.177
(Speak.)

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.440
(I don't know. I really don't know)

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.630
(why did she go there.)

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.670
(Lawyer Cao.)

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.360
(We start the second phase now.)

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:35.920
(Okay.)

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.070
Dad, didn't we agree

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.190
that I would go?

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.550
You are the first phase.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.550
Based on what we know about the police,

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.200
they will definitely suspect
the first person to confess.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.150
So we prepared a second plan.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.920
After you confess,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.150
we'll gradually release clues,

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.880
making it seem

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.400
that Mr. Wu has
long hated the Xu family,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.030
so he incited Wang Dan to crash
the car and force you to confess.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.710
Two birds, one stone.

00:37:08.822 --> 00:37:10.555
Strike at two generations
of the Xu family.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.320
The police focus

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.590
isn't on Wang Dan's accident.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.230
They really want to know

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.760
what's really going on with
the body in the statue.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.880
Soon, they'll trace it to the group,

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.480
and to me.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.360
I'll go in to get you out.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400
Dad, then what about...

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:29.400
Let me finish.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.320
Wang Dan is an outsider.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.590
Someone must have sent her

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.550
to crash into the statue.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.670
Who is this person?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.070
What is their goal?

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.400
What else are they planning?

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:41.440
We don't know.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.110
The enemy is in the dark,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440
and we are in the open.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.670
It's dangerous.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.480
Only if I go in

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.440
can I buy you and Feifei

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.190
more time to respond.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.150
Uncle Ming will also help you

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.840
find this person.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.360
Dad, still...

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.710
For Penglai Group,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.960
it's right for me to risk my life.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.590
Yang, don't put
too much pressure on yourself.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.150
Doing this isn't just for the company,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.190
not just for your dad, not just for me,

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.960
it's for Feifei.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.760
In fact,

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.000
the only one who could have
harmed Wang Dan was Feifei.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.590
A father protecting his daughter

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.480
is only natural.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.880
Yang.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.630
Your dad has gone.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.710
I'm old, too.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.070
It's time to pass the company
to you young ones.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.440
You are now the pillar.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.590
If I ever missed something in the past,

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.150
don't blame me.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.840
Alright, be a man.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.150
Hurry, keep going.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.960
(Why were these things)

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.710
(only told to me today?)

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.480
Couldn't you tell me sooner?

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.000
Because your acting isn't good.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.920
With your acting,

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.800
how could you handle those people?

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.440
You see,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.070
strong externally,

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.000
too soft internally.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.440
Sorry, girl.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.280
I lied to you, but I faked being ill

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.920
not just to help you
and Yang's marriage.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.760
Actually, I'm old now,

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.400
and my health is failing.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.800
I wanted to push you all to the front,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.030
to take responsibility.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.550
What do you call this?

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.880
I call it being shrewd.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.630
That's exactly right.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.110
You even know.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.840
- Yes.
- Being shrewd.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.480
The insulin pump
has been bought for you.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.480
(My best friend once told me)

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.422
(she envied me for having
a 90% perfect family.)

00:40:25.622 --> 00:40:27.150
(I told her she didn't understand.)

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.960
(How perfect a family is)

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.555
(determines how much
responsibility you bear to protect it.)

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.960
(But I still misunderstood
this responsibility.)

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:37.920
Dad,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.400
what were people like

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.760
who had no way to turn back in that era?

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.590
After so many years,

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.000
it's a bit hazy.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.150
I can't remember.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.360
(I'm protecting more than just a home.)

00:41:07.355 --> 00:41:09.400
(I'm doing more than being a daughter,)

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.510
(not just a wife,)

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800
(I'm someone
guarding something precious)

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.150
(with no way to turn back.)

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.550
Miss Wu,

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.480
you and your dad may leave.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.110
My dad already told you?

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.030
Yes. Xu Zhiyang said it, too.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.630
He believes your dad targeted Xu Peng

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:52.920
and thus instigated Wang Dan.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.800
But we may leave now?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.630
The three of you only have statements,

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.590
no evidence.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.800
Xu Zhiyang will be treated
as a personal dispute for now.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.110
He cannot leave
the detention center soon.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.480
If there are new developments
regarding the bones,

00:42:08.688 --> 00:42:11.222
your dad will need
to cooperate in the investigation again.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:16.070
Miss Wu,

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.150
