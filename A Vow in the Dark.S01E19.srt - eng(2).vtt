Jie Chuan!

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.840

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.680
Wake up now!

The Devourer is gnawing your mind.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.280
Wake up!

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.190
Jie Chuan,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.040
protecting her
while you're going frenzy.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.710
How touching.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.400
But you have only a shred of will now;

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.680
soon you'll be my nourishment.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.070
Jie Chuan...

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.200
Interesting.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.070
You still love her even now.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.710
In that case,

Jie Chuan, wake up.

I was wrong. Sorry.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.990
Jie Chuan,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.360
I really

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.280
love you.

Yesterday,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.870
you begged me to live,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.240
saying...

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.840
Jie Chuan, wake up.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.710
I was wrong. Sorry.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.240

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.280
I really

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.590
love you.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.950
I spoke in haste.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.120
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.400
Besides,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.680
you're the almighty Demon Sovereign

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.120
who'd wipe out

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.680
immortals.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.070
I saved you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.630
only for peace,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.720
not worry.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.630
Don't fret.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.030
Ji Li,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.480
if I ask for your hand,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.160
would you agree?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.120
If the two realms

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.680
need a bridge,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.070
I'll be it.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.560
But if it's for love alone,

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.270
I refuse.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.400
After all,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.100
immortals and demons are different.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.110
Very well.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.190
For the two clans alone.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.070
After the wedding,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.630
I'll set you free.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.640
(Ji Li,)

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.870
(what's the difference)

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.920
(between immortals and demons?)

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.680
(Once the traitor's found,)

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.390
(I'll give you a peaceful world.)

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.750
(You won't be harmed again.)

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.600
The realms are settled.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.640
What should we do

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.070
about the immortals?

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.680
Demons will move to the Immortal Realm.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.120
You're the sovereign of both.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.760
Why not

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.310
slaughter them all

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.870
to avoid future troubles?

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.830
From Jie Chuan

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.680
to Ji Li:

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.190
Let us bind our lives

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.120
and get married.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.240
With only you by my side,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.800
the knot will be tied,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.560
and we'll grow old together.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.050
Both the immortals and the demons

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.630
will live in peace.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.720
Jie Chuan and Ji Li

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.310
shall have eternal love.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.390
Thus agreed.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.030
I object!

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.590
Jie Chuan,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.750
have you forgotten?

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.600
We swore

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.830
to exterminate every immortal.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.310
Immortals are

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.390
all hypocrites.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.510
Why marry one now?

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.110
Now,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.040
you're their sovereign.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.870
Any method serves.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.510
Why marry her?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.440
Luo Cha,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.630
if we keep sinning

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.480
without conscience,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.360
how are we better than them?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.670
Two days ago,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.950
I found the frenzy rage

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.160
is born

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.270
of a fiend

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.950
that feeds on threads of love,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.370
regardless of the race.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.510
It almost possessed me,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.870
but Ji Li saved me.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.720
Why were you attacked?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.720
Only you went to Wasteland

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.120
the day before the festival.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.110
Luo Cha,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.920
one tug

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.160
unravels all.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.920
Perhaps you didn't mean it,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.270
but can you still control

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.190
the current situation?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.800
All I did was

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.950
for demons.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.480
I believe your heart

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.950
is with our people.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.670
There is

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.240
one last chance:

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.600
At the wedding,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.870
strike the fiend down.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.710
Yes.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.320
I'll obey.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.720
(Jie Chuan, don't hate me.)

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.360
(Luo Cha,)

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.550
(everyone makes mistakes.)

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.480
(If you come back,)

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.840
(you'll still be my family.)

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.390
Devourer,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.080
how dare you possess my brother

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.840
and feed on demons?

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.670
You are no demon.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.480
What are you?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.750
Someone

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.240
must've instructed you today.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.790
What?

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.730
You're finally clever.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.200
However,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.030
it's too late.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.200
Haven't you noticed?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.960
From the moment we met,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.360
I planted the frenzy seed.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.000
Demons are so ridiculous.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.480
Your cause failed

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.270
because of one woman.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.390
Luckily, I had you,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.630
so I could reignite hatred

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.270
between the realms

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.630
when they were seeking peace.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.480
Your goal

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.670
is to ignite the great war?

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.550
In 3,000 years of battles,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.870
the hate of countless corpses forged me:

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.550
I'm neither immortal

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.110
nor demon.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.510
Luo Cha,

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.320
you cannot kill me;

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.320
Jie Chuan cannot kill me.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.200
Jie Chuan,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.870
I'm coming for you.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.750
Master,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.480
do you know why the halls
are empty today?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.720
The Immortal Realm is deserted;

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.400
all have gone to the Demon Realm

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960
for Jie Chuan and Ji Li's wedding.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.840
I forgot.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.670
Wounded by Jie Chuan,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.790
you can no longer hear.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.280
Master,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.720
if I strip your immortal bones,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.870
you'll be mortal;

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.030
we can live as a mortal couple

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.750
and stay together forever.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.080
Don't worry.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.000
I'll protect you.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.720
In your dreams.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.150
Master!

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.510
Master,

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.200
I love you so.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.960
Why will you never see me?

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.120
Huan Zhen,

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.230
let go.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.590
Master,

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.750
I beg you.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.630
Look at me.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.320
Please look at me.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.320
Just once, Master!

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.040
Master!

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.350
Huan Zhen,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.440
our lives

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.320
were never our own.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.270
Why insist

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.720
on sabotaging our plan

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.270
and betraying us?

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.550
Betray you?

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.790
I betrayed

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.120
the clan

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.150
only for you.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.390
You are mine;

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.030
I won't give anyone else

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.000
the chance to steal you.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.600
Huan Zhen,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.200
have you forgotten

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.670
everything I taught you?

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.240
What is honesty and truth?

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.120
Tell me.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.960
I gave you immortal arts

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.960
and shaped you into human form,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.030
not so you could betray the immortals.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.750
You disappoint me.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.720
Stay here

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.030
and reflect.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.480
Master,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.720
I'll return everything

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.030
you ever gave me.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.390
Huan Zhen!

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.750
Luo Cha

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.390
has been gone for a day.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.600
You know she's the traitor.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.390
Why let her leave?

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.870
She is my sister;

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.600
I trust her.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.390
I fear

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.440
she cannot kill the Devourer

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.390
and will only alert him.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.920
Don't worry.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.360
The Devourer feeds on threads of love.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.120
Today, at our wedding,

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.750
with me gravely wounded,

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.870
he will not miss such a chance.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.630
He will come.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.790
Your Grace,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.630
bad news.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.440
Hong Zhua has escaped.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.480
Shall we summon guards to pursue?

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.350
No need.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.200
Perhaps

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.360
we should postpone the wedding.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.010
Nothing is more important
than our wedding.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.150
Carry out the orders.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.200
Who will command

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.470
the guards?

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.390
You're in charge.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.040
In the past,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.270
she hated her mismatched eyes most

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.030
and used power

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.360
to hide them.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.630
She is

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.030
no longer Luo Cha.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.300
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:44.260

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.980

♪Filling my dreams

♪All my best years were for you♪

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:25.540
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:33.060
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:40.180
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪
