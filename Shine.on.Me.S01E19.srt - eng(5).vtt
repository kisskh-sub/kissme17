[Episode 19]

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.600
Lin Yusen always carries himself

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.680
with such ease and confidence.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.820
I had no idea he went through

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.920
so much growing up.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.060
He didn't even have
his mom there for him.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.640
The Sheng family
was on a real tear back then.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.120
But as things turned out,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.700
those sons of Chairman Sheng

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.240
were entirely eclipsed by Lin's father.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.080
Whatever went down

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.840
at Shengyuan,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.300
Lin's father

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.060
was suddenly shipped off overseas

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.620
to spearhead market expansion.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
He stayed away for years.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.740
Then,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.500
a coup broke out in that country.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.440
He got hurt in the crossfire.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.780
Without timely medical attention,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.540
he just passed away.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.100
Life is just so unpredictable.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.320
That old man is absolutely insufferable.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.040
He milked his talents
for all he's worth,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.100
and then kicked him to the curb
the minute the job's done.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.840
Playing these dirty tricks
even on his family.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.340
This is definitely not

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.700
what he wanted either.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.579
But he's the one who caused it.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.600
Ms. Sheng

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.280
probably figures the same.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.620
Right after Mr. Lin passed away,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.720
she headed overseas straight off.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.060
Word is

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.340
that even when her dad fell ill,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.300
she never returned.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.600
So Lin left the country too?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.040
They say

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.040
he stayed behind
to take care of his dad's parents.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.020
It's heartbreaking for the old folks,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.480
and just as much for Lin.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.579
You blew your cover

that if I didn't come clean sooner,

I'd start losing points
in your mom's book.

So you just threw me under the bus?

I haven't settled the score with you

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.200
for lying to me earlier today.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.560
Then you stole my fireworks,

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.560
and you headed out
without even bringing me along.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.560
You're getting
more and more out of line.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.540
No way.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.200
Tell your boss

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.120
I'm calling him out.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.160
What's wrong?

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:34.860
See for yourself.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.820
[Jiang Rui]

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.340
Ask him what the challenge is.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.080
Alright.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.980
He wants to know what the challenge is.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.640
I knew she ran off with that guy.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.000
A pursuit race.
Tomorrow on the black runs.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.620
Alright.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.880
Challenge accepted.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.820
She just lets him use her phone?

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.140
Such a pushover.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.060
I'm heading back.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.940
Wait.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.820
I made this while waiting for you
this morning.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.060
I was too embarrassed
to give it to you in front of everyone.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.780
Oh, a skiing one today?

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.600
You're really good with your hands.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.580
Maybe I just have a knack

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.420
for precision work.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.900
So what kind of snowman
is it going to be tomorrow?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.020
Tomorrow?

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.180
Haven't come up with a design yet.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.560
I'll have to think about it.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:28.900
Alright then.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.000
Well,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.620
see you tomorrow.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.360
See you tomorrow.

Where did Jiang Rui and Xiguang go?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.960
They're already out the door this early?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.280
Hu had breakfast delivered.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.180
I've warmed it up.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.200
Come grab some before it gets cold.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.420
They headed out bright and early.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.920
Said he's off to compete with Lin.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.020
I told them not to push too hard.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.040
They've really hit it off quick,
haven't they?

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.180
Come on, you know your son.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.400
He's always been Mr. Social.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.760
I stayed up thinking it over last night.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.240
And I'm a lot calmer now.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.140
Lin's a great catch, no doubt,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.780
but with relationships,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.080
you just can't rush into them.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.140
We gotta let Xiguang

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.600
spend more time with him first
and see how it goes.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.800
That's exactly right.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.480
When I was young,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.680
I learned that lesson the hard way.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.960
What's the plan for today?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.080
Hu said

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:17.960
he'll take us

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.040
to check out downtown Yanji.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.500
You go enjoy yourselves.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.880
I'm not gonna tag along
as the third wheel.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.440
I'll just poke around near the hotel.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:26.860
Ms. Sheng

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:27.880
invited me for tea

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.900
in the snow hut this afternoon.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.460
You're seriously racing

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.100
Lin Yusen?

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.280
Isn't this whole race thing

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.920
super cringey?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.100
How so?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.840
This is a total adrenaline rush.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:44.960
Come on, Lin,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.680
we doing this or what?

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.960
I even switched to snowboard for this.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.700
What do you think?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.820
Why go snowboard?

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.520
Skis have higher speed.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.260
Jiang Rui's gonna be salty if he loses.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.980
No pre-race smack talk.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.180
This is interfering with the game.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.340
My bad.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.860
I thought it was part
of the adrenaline rush.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.680
Alright.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.740
You guys go get your adrenaline pumping.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.400
I'll be chilling at the bottom.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.720
We can all head up together.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.339
There's a café at the top.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.000
You wanna see the view from the summit?

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:25.920
Let's roll.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.740
This is the mighty peak

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.340
we're gonna conquer!

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.580
Stand farther away.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.200
Don't let anyone think

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.280
we're together with him.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:45.860
Xiguang,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.200
let's grab a seat
at the café over there.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.120
Easy now.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.740
Let's see

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.840
which run we're taking.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.740
You're even more hyped

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.920
than Jiang Rui.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.840
You really came prepared, huh?

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.940
Good thing I did my homework too.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.540
I suggest

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.580
we take this one.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.440
It's the longest,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.360
so we can really let loose.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.520
Sounds good.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.680
I was checking it out

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.360
on the gondola just now.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.980
Hardly anyone's on it,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.460
so it's pretty safe.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.660
I'll head down and snap a couple photos.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.580
You two figure out

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.700
the rules for your race.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.760
Bye-bye.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.700
What do you feel like drinking?

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.640
I'll skip the coffee.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.860
Grab me an electrolyte drink

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.640
for a quick recharge.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.680
Same here.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.160
Alright.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.240
I'll take these.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.980
When we hit this run in a bit,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.160
make sure you slow down right here.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.120
Pay attention.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.600
There's a steep drop.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.740
If you don't ease off,

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.480
it'll be dangerous.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.120
Slow down? Nah.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.540
I'll just blast right through it.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.480
The view here is incredible.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.000
Better start thinking
about how to get down.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.940
You insisted on coming up with me.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.420
Worst case,
I'll just take the gondola back.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.460
It's a deal then.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.340
Let's take this run.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.060
First one down wins.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.280
You're on.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.420
But let's set some ground rules.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.360
Safety first, competition second.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.340
Just ski at your own pace.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.560
Don't go blowing past your limit

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.760
just to win.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.980
Of course.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.780
My precious life

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.140
has only just begun.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.200
I'm not looking for a trip
to Orthopedics.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.900
But if you lose,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.740
you have to stop chasing Xiguang.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.420
A race is just a race.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.940
It's got nothing to do with her.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.080
Even if I lose,
I'm still going to pursue her.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.700
But isn't the way you put it

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.800
a bit inappropriate?

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.000
What if she hears about this...?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.400
Wait, that's not what I meant.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.840
Don't make it into something it's not.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.100
You're not going
to snitch on me, are you?

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:01.940
Are we good now

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.620
regarding the time

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.760
Xiguang and I

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.600
lied to you?

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.740
Fine.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.700
Just act like

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.740
I never said a word.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.700
Otherwise,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.260
she'll probably beat me to death

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:12.780
with her ski poles.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.300
Is she really that violent?

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.440
Of course...

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.880
Of course not.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.120
Xiguang is very reasonable.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.420
That pattern

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.200
on your snowboard is so unique.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.940
I've never seen anything like it.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.180
It even looks like there's a signature.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.000
Yeah.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.380
My mom had it custom-made for me.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.060
If you like it,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:43.860
I can get one made for you too.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.500
Don't try to bribe me.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.660
Until you're officially

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.560
Xiguang's boyfriend,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.940
I'm not accepting any gifts from you.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.680
You're really sticking
to your guns, huh?

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.200
I'm not accepting it

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.240
because my resolve isn't that strong.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.120
Come on, let's go.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.560
Let's shred.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.200
What does "chase" mean?

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.500
Didn't Zhuang Xu
say she has a boyfriend?

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.800
Could it be that they broke up,

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.580
and this guy's her new suitor?

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.120
See? What did I tell you?

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.840
He's not her boyfriend.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.200
Don't go blabbing

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.280
about it everywhere.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.400
It's none of your business.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.400
Of course I won't say anything.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.700
I don't even know them.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.480
Why would I care?

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.780
I'll count down three-two-one,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.820
and you both start together.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.340
Stay safe, guys.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.260
Safety comes first.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.920
The First Xiguang Cup Pursuit Race

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.580
at Changbai Mountain

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.260
is about to begin.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.280
Both racers are in position.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.220
Three...

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:04.760
Two...

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:07.760
One...

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.960
Go!

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.180
That was insane.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.780
I wish I were that good.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.580
Lin Yusen.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.040
Who won?

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.880
It was super close.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.280
I barely edged him out.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:55.820
Alright.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.020
There's still a bit of a gap, honestly.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.340
But come on, I haven't skied at all

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.040
for three years of high school.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.140
Give me some time, and we'll go again.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.420
I'm ready whenever.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.000
I just got

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.020
some clips of you two.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:04.940
That was seriously awesome.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:05.860
Check this out.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.640
I've made up my mind.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.040
I'm going to tackle the black runs too.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.040
You should fully conquer

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.820
the green runs first,

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.880
then move on to the blue ones.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.240
Don't try to bite off
more than you can chew

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.320
and end up having to walk down,

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.200
blocking everyone else on the slope.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.880
Hey, talk nicely.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.760
Xiguang, you actually hit me?

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.860
I was putting in a good word
for you, alright?

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.760
Why does it sound like

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.020
you were bad-mouthing me?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:30.820
No way.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.420
I just said you have

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.500
that nurturing yet firm vibe.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.780
You'd better not have.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.180
Besides, I never say

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.460
I am heading straight
to the black runs this time.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.560
I'll take it step by step, obviously.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:42.340
Fine.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.420
I'm done talking to you two.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.820
You go have fun on the black runs.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.780
I'm grabbing my board

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.900
and heading
to the green runs to practice.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:47.960
I'll go with you.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.980
No, go enjoy your own runs.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.500
You're not mad, are you?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.200
Mad at you? As if.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.440
You guys are black-run level.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.580
Skiing greens with me

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.800
would be no fun at all for you.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.140
That's why I said we should split up.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.240
Yeah, it's true.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.940
Too flat, and way too crowded.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.680
Can't pick up any speed.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.280
Then it's settled.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.800
We'll just ride at our own pace

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.440
and meet up for lunch.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.240
I'll go off on my own tomorrow.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.920
But today, I'm sticking with you.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.020
No.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.340
I appreciate the thought,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.760
but my training plan

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.500
can't get messed up.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.180
What training plan?

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.420
This afternoon,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.080
I'm taking you to the blue runs.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.820
Well,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:27.860
fine.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:31.840
Cheesy.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.180
What's up?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.280
Hey,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.600
what's with the secrecy?

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.080
You've gotta play it smart

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.200
with your dating this time, okay?

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.180
Can't be all straight-up like before.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.960
Wait a sec.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.120
We're not dating yet.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:48.840
I know.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.000
I'm just saying, when dealing with guys,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.600
you need tactics.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.860
You've never even been
in a relationship,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.840
and you're giving me advice?

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.840
Internet wisdom.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.040
Plus tips from the dorm crew.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.060
Anyway,

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.860
while you were riding the gondola,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.740
I laid the groundwork for you.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.820
Now I'm just reminding you.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.440
Don't spill the beans.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.140
What groundwork?

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.360
It's supposed to be super effective.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.180
I told him,

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.880
"This is the first time

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.960
Xiguang has ever stayed out this late

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.720
with a guy."

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.220
And

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300
"This is the first time Xiguang

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.020
has cared this much about a guy."

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:18.960
That's it.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.400
What?

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:21.860
Jiang Rui,

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.420
this is also the first time

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.280
I've ever smacked you on the head.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.880
Let's go.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.760
Be safe, okay?

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.360
Hey, loosen up.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.940
These blue runs aren't super steep.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.440
I'm totally chill.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.100
Should I have let

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.480
Jiang Rui win

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.280
this morning's race?

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.940
No way, of course not.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.500
I'm not really

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.500
that competitive about it.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.740
When I pulled ahead of him,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.540
I did think about it for a split second.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.260
But then I remembered

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.820
you named this whole thing,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.240
and I immediately dropped

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.280
the idea.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:11.760
Xiguang Cup.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.120
There's no way I'm giving it up.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.720
This is the first time I've seen Yusen

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.580
care this much

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.460
about a girl.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.200
You sound like

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.400
he's never been

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.920
in a relationship.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.720
He has been

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.420
all about books and work
ever since he was a kid.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.360
Always making plans for everything

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.300
except romance.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.020
If I hadn't heard

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.000
that from you,

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.600
I never would've believed it.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.940
I'm a bit surprised.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960
Maybe

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.740
it's the family influence.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.820
He's just gotten used to
his own company.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.580
Lin's really outstanding,

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.180
and he has a great personality too.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:07.780
Yes,

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.360
I can

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.660
absolutely vouch for him on that.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.840
Maybe we should just

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.160
let them be

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.420
and stay out of their business.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.700
That's the greatest vote of confidence

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.960
you could ever show him.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.100
So you've been in Switzerland

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.560
this whole time?

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.720
I'm teaching at a university

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.000
there in Switzerland.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.980
The guy you met yesterday

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.600
is my current husband, Luo.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.220
We got married a few years ago.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:37.900
That's good to hear.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.480
We should always look ahead.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.020
What about you?

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.780
You probably already know

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.220
I got divorced

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.580
from Xiguang's dad a few years back.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.620
I heard of it.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.660
I always thought

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.760
couples who built everything

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.040
from scratch together,

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.080
would be different somehow.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.700
Never imagined...

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.620
Well,

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.580
we're different anyway.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.240
I walked away with half his fortune.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.920
Now that's the kind of talk
that warms the heart.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.600
We should definitely drink to that.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:13.760
Cheers.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.180
What are you up to these days?

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.900
I kept some shares.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.260
Ever since the divorce,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.900
I stopped getting involved
in the day-to-day operations.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.800
These days I'm just taking it easy,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.220
doing some casual investing,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.320
picking up a bit of spare change.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.020
It's quite comfortable
being less hands-on.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.660
That said,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.160
I can't help feeling it's a loss.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.700
Back then, I always thought

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.280
you had sharper business instincts

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.800
and more talent

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.620
than your ex-husband.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.740
You're back, Mom.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.740
Where are Uncle and Aunt?

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.120
I wasn't with them.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.240
I had tea with Lin's mom

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.200
this afternoon.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.080
We chatted for so long
that we ended up having dinner together.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.100
You didn't say anything about me,
did you?

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.380
No. What, you think

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.040
we don't have
our own things to talk about?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.340
We just reminisced about old times.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.540
What were you acting out just now?

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.420
Just watching

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.000
some ski tutorials.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.540
You know, practicing on the sly.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.380
Did Jiang Rui rub off on you
or something?

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.280
You're more dedicated to skiing

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.920
than to anything else.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.620
I'm dedicated at work too,

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.440
you know.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.760
Lin Yusen

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.000
threw a bunch of stuff at me,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.300
and I finished
everything "above and beyond."

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.580
Those were his exact words.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.080
Okay, practice away.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:49.880
I'm heading for a shower.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:50.660
Don't leave yet.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.560
I have a question about work

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.160
to run by you.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.300
Take a seat.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.440
Here's the thing.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.740
My company

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.820
is expanding the plant.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.400
And there's this piece of land

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.700
that we haven't decided
what to do with yet.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.640
So I suggested turning it

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.660
into a PV garden.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.320
After talking it over

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320
with Engineering and Tech,

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.560
we're planning

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.840
to make the main structure

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.240
of the garden BIPV.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.200
That way it's more energy-efficient,
looks better,

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.380
and serves as a great showcase.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.460
But the technical challenges
are pretty big,

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.000
and the budget's way higher

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.960
than traditional methods.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.900
Mom, you used to work

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.080
in construction engineering.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.520
Do you have any tips

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.580
on how to cut costs

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.360
without lowering the standards?

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.080
Even though Lin Yusen said

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.460
he'll fully back me on this,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.160
I still want

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.000
to save where I can.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.260
You've really grown up.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.800
Happy to see you're starting

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.700
to take things seriously.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.720
You and Dad have the same habit.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.660
The second I do something
I'm supposed to,

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.440
you shower me with praise.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.860
I was talking about

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.780
how Dad used to be.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.800
That's actually not good, you know?

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.780
I didn't end up spoiled

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.420
all thanks to my solid moral compass.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.700
Aren't you pretty good

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.560
at praising yourself too?

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.360
The PV Garden

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.380
may seem straightforward,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.080
but managing every moving part

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.100
from top to bottom

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.820
is no less demanding

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.900
than a large-scale project.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.280
It's a great way to sharpen

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.940
your execution and delivery skills.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.220
Yeah.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.640
I was running
between departments so much

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.960
that I actually dropped a few pounds.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.620
Couldn't really tell.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.740
When it comes to solving funding issues,

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.120
it really boils down to this:

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.860
boosting revenue and cutting costs.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:31.960
For boosting revenue,

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.440
you could consider

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.000
whether you could introduce

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.080
some commercial operations,

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.340
like

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.100
selling drinks

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.000
or light snacks,

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.340
and then lease that part out

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.440
in advance.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.540
If your PV structure

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.720
represents advanced concepts

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.920
and has a demonstrative role,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.160
you could also look

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.420
into policy angles

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.680
to see if there's any way

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.240
to apply for government subsidies.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.400
As for cutting costs,

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.700
you'll need to tackle

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.340
every single link,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.420
design,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.300
material price comparisons,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.680
labor efficiency control.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.880
These are

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.600
all ways to manage expenses.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.540
Of course,

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.960
that would make things
a bit tougher for you.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.460
Financially,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.320
you could work out

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.820
reasonable payment schedules

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.840
with construction partners

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.480
already trusted by Shuangyuan.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.160
That could help, too.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.260
I'm starting to get some ideas.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.980
For the leasing,

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.100
I can ask

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.780
the cafeteria contractor at the company.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.940
As for price comparisons,

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.180
that's my specialty.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.540
The moment I joined,

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.740
Lin Yusen threw me

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.680
into a mountain

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.580
of sourcing and quoting.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.300
As for construction,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.140
I can consider

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.000
the contractor from Phase II.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.580
Given our history
of successful cooperation,

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.060
they'll likely be more flexible
on payment.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600
The previous halt in construction

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.200
was actually quite sudden

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.220
for the contractor,

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.100
so the new project scope

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.120
could be positioned

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.680
as compensation for that downtime.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.040
Got it.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.100
I'll think it through.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.420
As soon as I'm back, I'll get moving.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.840
For a company,

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:57.620
technology

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.060
will always be
the primary productive force.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.800
To embrace new technology

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.780
is always a step in the right direction.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.240
The greatest danger
in running a business

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.300
is developing a fear

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.240
of technical challenges

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.580
and a reluctance to invest.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.480
Companies that fail to innovate

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.980
will eventually be phased out.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.840
I've had several meetings

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.000
with Tech,

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.460
and I think they're

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.540
actually pretty impressive.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.800
Lin Yusen is very optimistic

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.500
about the PERC technology

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.600
they're developing.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.280
It could probably go
into mass production

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.000
in the second half of this year or next.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.020
There's one more thing,

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.260
also about the plant expansion.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.800
I only found out
just before Chinese New Year

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:32.560
that Dad's company

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.139
had been delaying payments
to the contractor.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.719
I was so embarrassed

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:36.860
when I learned about it.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.300
Even though no one

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.500
knows who I am at the company.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.280
I don't know

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.520
about that.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.080
Maybe he's facing
a bit of a cash crunch.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.380
Did Shengyuan pressure him?

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.580
I have no idea.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.239
But since Lin Yusen took over,

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:55.020
he secured a large sum

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.179
through financing.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.540
The capital pressure

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.300
might be manageable for now.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.120
Actually,

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:01.940
back in 2001,

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.220
I tried

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.500
to persuade your dad

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.360
to buy into a local PV company

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.180
in Wuxi.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.460
At the time, the government

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.640
was also lobbying us to invest.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:10.840
Unfortunately,

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.220
your father wasn't convinced

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.020
and didn't agree.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.200
I remember in that company meeting,

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.740
I suggested investing in PV,

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.760
but he wanted to invest
in something else.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.160
It ended up

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.260
with us investing in neither.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.900
Then how did Shuangyuan come to be?

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.820
That was in 2005,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.320
when I brought it up again.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.740
He was still hesitant at first,

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.380
but then,

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.040
the Sheng family got interested too.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.620
When they reached out to him,

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.880
he jumped at the chance.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.580
Sadly, by then we had already missed

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.400
the first explosive wave
of the PV industry.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.020
How could he be like that?

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.140
He wouldn't agree when you suggested it.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.720
Don't overthink it.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.380
He had his own views,

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.760
and they definitely held
their own weight.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:50.920
Later on,

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.100
maybe he just couldn't resist

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.640
after seeing that 2003 market rally.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:54.800
Mom,

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.800
was that company from 2001

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.080
you mentioned

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.880
Wanyang Photovoltaic?

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.600
From what I can tell,

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.360
they aren't doing too well these days.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.820
A few years back,

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.560
Wanyang bought back shares
for their IPO,

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.120
so the initial investors

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.280
walked away with massive payouts,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.080
over ten times

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.000
their investment.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.100
If we had jumped in back then,

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.300
we would've made a killing.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040
Wanyang

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.500
is definitely in hot water now.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.800
The business world is a battlefield.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.760
One wrong move

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.520
and it's game over.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.700
The industry has its ups and downs,

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.620
and crises always come out of nowhere.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.240
If

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.300
you're going to run a business someday,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.920
there's a paradox

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.800
you must remember:

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.440
Business
is inherently about chasing profit,

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.360
yet

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.800
you must remain clear-headed

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.520
amidst all the fame and fortune.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.020
Back then, I always thought

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.500
you had sharper business instincts

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.920
and more talent

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:14.700
than your ex-husband.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:16.720
Chengyuan,

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.660
I believe this is

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.520
the best time

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.280
to enter the PV industry.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.360
In contrast, Mr. Xu's project

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.640
carries too much risk.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.840
We can't be this reckless.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.720
Yun,

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:24.900
could you at least

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.940
show me some respect at the company?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.420
That's exactly why

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.660
I'm telling you this in your office

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.120
rather than at the meeting.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:30.940
The meeting just ended,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.680
and you chased me
all the way to my office

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.560
with a scowl on your face.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.580
Everyone can see

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.000
that you disagree with me.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.280
If the decision changes later,

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.220
everyone will know

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.400
that you're the one calling the shots.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.380
Isn't this how we've always done it?

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.760
We've always talked things through.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.940
That was then.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:44.980
Besides,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.360
you call this a collaborative attitude?

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.940
You're forcing me to do it your way.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.060
I'm certain my attitude
is collaborative.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.380
It's the same attitude

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.600
you used to have no problem with.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.320
I haven't changed.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.640
It's your perception that has changed.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:04.600
Yun,

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.060
I really don't want

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.020
all this work stuff

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.980
to come between us.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.460
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.260
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.280
Okay, cheers.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.180
They say

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.500
a good wife keeps
her husband out of trouble.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:27.720
Nie,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.020
you're truly blessed

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.220
to have such a supportive wife
like Jiang Yun.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.680
I heard

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.620
she was the one who stopped you

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.300
from investing in Xu's project.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.660
It's a good thing you passed on it.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.600
Mr. Gai took the plunge,

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.220
and now he's

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:40.920
completely stuck.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.760
His cash flow is at a breaking point.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.520
I'm a lucky man.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.800
Well, everyone in Wuxi

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.780
knows that.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.180
That's true.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.340
We always

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440
talk things

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.760
through.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.040
Come on.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:55.580
Here.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.700
- Let's have another toast.
- Cheers.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.340
Come on.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:11.940
Okay.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.080
Thanks, Rui.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.280
Good boy.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.960
Thanks, Hu.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.460
Today's family time is checked off.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.160
I'm heading out to ski with Xiguang
this afternoon.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.220
Just go by yourself.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.160
Why do you keep dragging Xiguang along?

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:30.880
Hey,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.220
she's the one who's hooked now,

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:32.700
okay?

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.820
She and Lin

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.500
are meeting

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.680
at the ski center at 1 PM.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.060
Just ask her yourself.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.100
Where is she?

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.920
Nie Xiguang.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:47.900
Nie Xiguang!

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.520
Coming.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.660
Don't run off, Jiang Rui!

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.220
Hey.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.540
The snow is blowing

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.220
right into my face.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.160
So, let's stick to the plan
from yesterday:

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.400
we each do our own thing today.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:12.800
Works for me.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.780
It's almost 1 PM now.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.860
What time should we regroup?

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.140
5:30 PM.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.600
That's nearly five hours.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.620
Can your legs even handle that?

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.300
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.300
Besides, we're leaving
the day after tomorrow.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.460
We should make the most of it
while we can.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.820
Lin,

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.820
are you leaving tomorrow afternoon?

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.620
Yeah, I'm flying to Beijing
tomorrow night.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.740
My mom and Mr. Luo

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.580
are heading back to Switzerland
the day after.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.240
She's heading back

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.360
to Switzerland already?

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.660
Yeah, they've got work to get back to.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.140
5 30 PM it is, then.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.160
Should we take a break

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.880
together in between?

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:43.880
Definitely not.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.000
Our bathroom breaks

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.820
are never going to line up anyway.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.100
It's a deal, then.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.100
Tonight,

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.500
the snow hut hotpot is on me.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.300
Deal.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.340
Let's go.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:56.920
Let's...

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.220
go!

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.400
Kevin, you got this?

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.120
[Descente Challenge Run]
Or you wanna just take the gondola?

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.660
Please.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.360
Never ask a man if he can handle it,

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.760
okay?

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.200
Look,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.000
it's the last day.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.300
I've gotta push myself a little.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.560
Besides,

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.460
if I can't make it,

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.240
I'll just ski half and hike half,

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:36.760
alright?

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.760
Zhuang, you're sticking with me.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.700
And here I thought he was gonna

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.800
give some grand manifesto.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.580
Whatever, I'm leaving you to it.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.100
Min,

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:44.800
let's go.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.220
Bye.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.380
See ya!

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.180
Zhuang,

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.780
you better slow down.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.360
We're the only two newbies

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.140
left to look out for each other.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.760
Don't worry,

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.420
risk management is my second nature.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:01.600
Zhuang,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.220
I think I see that guy who's chasing

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.840
your student's cousin.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.440
He looks so slick out there.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.960
Seems like a total pro.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.920
Chasing who?

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.120
The one chasing your student's cousin.
