WEBVTT

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.899
The four sisters are so united.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.340
Muscular and mighty.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.500
Not creepy, refined and gentle.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.820
What are you looking at?

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.740
Full of vitality and vigor.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.579
Happily moving into the dorm.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:06.540
What are you looking at?

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.180
What are you looking at?

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.859
What are you looking at?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.099
What are you looking at?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.340
What are you looking at?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.620
This silly deer.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.819
That's my roommate, Datou Wen.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.099
In the days to come,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.620
he would become my most annoying jerk of a friend,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.859
but also

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.579
the most reliable one.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.219
Through everyone's efforts,

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.340
we managed to secure our own dorm room

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.540
in the land-scarce Hong Kong, China.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.700
Friend.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.579
Friend.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.140
You're a fan of Fatt Gor too?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.859
Did you know?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.500
He and I are from the same hometown.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.420
We even share the same childhood nickname.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:52.739
Both called Xigou.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.540
Who? Who's a dog?

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.859
I'm the dog.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.540
Yeah, dog.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.700
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.579
Xigou.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:02.260
Touch it.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.819
I'll take my shirt off and scare you to death.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:06.980
I'm Xigou.

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:08.180
That hurts, bro.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.860
What a thing to say.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.979
Bro.

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:13.419
What about "bro"?

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.340
It means

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.340
brother.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.780
Don't you think the two of us

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.500
could be like those three,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.419
good brothers?

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.139
Looking out for each other.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:29.259
Alright.

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:31.180
I'll be your brother.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.340
I didn't understand a word of that,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.259
but I like your personality.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.180
Fine.

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.900
From now on, I've got your back.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.259
It's okay.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:43.900
Even though I didn't understand a single sentence,

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.939
just remember this:

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.060
If you have me with you,

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.180
you'll definitely pass the exams.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:53.860
What if we totally misunderstood each other?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.180
Soft laughter brings me warmth.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.900
You charge me up with joy.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.099
Softly saying,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.099
the long road is almost behind us.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.900
Finally reaching a bright, sunny day.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.659
Fatt Gor.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.180
Brother Ma.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:40.659
I'm not telling you.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.979
I've been down on my luck for three years,

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.300
just waiting for one chance.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.500
To prove myself.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.620
Not to prove to others

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.219
how amazing I am.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.060
Just to tell them

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.740
what I've lost,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.500
I'll take it back myself.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.180
The signal is too strong.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.740
All signals are gone.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.340
Boss.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.699
I'm using low frequency.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.419
That won't work either.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.259
What are you looking at?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.740
What's it to you?

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.540
Even though we were talking past each other,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.100
because of Fatt Gor,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.019
we understood each other.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:33.860
Sorry, sorry.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.180
Hurry up, what's the holdup?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.660
Ordering takeout is so convenient.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.860
Save a penny where you can.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.500
Why do we have to...

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.060
Move aside, move aside.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.339
Wait, wait, wait.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.300
Sorry, sorry, ma'am.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.500
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.860
Iced Yuenyeung.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.939
Made it myself.

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:55.500
Yes, made it myself, myself.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:56.899
I know you two.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.980
You applied to be my graduate students.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.620
Fourteen people applied this year.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.899
I'm only taking two.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.939
Good luck.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.740
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.980
Watched too much Hong Kong, China TV, huh?

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.660
So fierce.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.500
Refreshing.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.980
Cool you down.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.860
Oh my goodness.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.339
We both smoothly

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:49.980
got accepted as Teacher He's graduate students.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:50.620
After that,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.060
we successfully became

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.980
her PhD students.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.740
We seemed to see

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.620
the dawn of victory.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.540
However...

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:00.860
Going crazy.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.579
Really going crazy.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.899
Five times.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.060
The thesis got rejected five times.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.819
Do they even want us to graduate?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.660
If we'd known, we shouldn't have

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.019
asked The Goddess to be our advisor.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.019
What "Goddess"?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.620
Isn't she The Ice Queen?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.300
You're right.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.899
But don't worry this time.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.100
I asked my mom to go to the temple

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.980
and pray for blessings.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.980
I'm sure,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.019
I guarantee,

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.100
this time it will definitely pass.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.579
Technology isn't child's play.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.300
You need innovation, but it must be practical.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.899
It's easy to talk when you're not the one doing the work.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.060
What did you say?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.300
I said...

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.300
What kind of innovation is this?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.180
What kind of practical application is this?

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.699
What?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.699
Do you want us to build you a rocket?

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:41.420
Would that make you happy?

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:42.740
We've followed you for five years, boss.

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.620
Search the entire school.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.579
How many are there who...

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:46.540
...can live in the lab more than us?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.100
Do you really think staying up all night...

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.540
...and living in the lab...

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.980
...is all there is to academia?

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:52.740
The real difficulty...

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.660
...lies in...

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.220
...when you're gritting your teeth and persevering...

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.420
...you still have to accept...

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.540
...being rejected time and again.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.339
The real difficulty...

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.620
...is when you think you...

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.579
...have already worked hard enough...

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.259
...but in the end...

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.579
...still no one recognizes you.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.459
It's watching others...

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:05.300
...move faster than you...

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.100
...and you still have to force yourself...

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.740
...to go slower...

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.740
...and steadier.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:12.180
We completely understand what you're saying.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.579
We agree with all of it.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.459
Lucy, we know we were wrong.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.899
Actually, Xiaoyu...

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:20.740
...was just a bit too impatient.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.019
What are you in such a hurry for?

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.899
Steven Zhou next door...

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.660
...his robotics project...

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.060
His teacher...

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.339
...secured him a spot...

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.139
...at an American lab.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.980
He even bought...

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.139
...a big house over there.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.220
Do you really think...

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.220
...you can get rich off this?

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.100
I won't mentor students like this.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.779
Get out.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.540
Fine, we're leaving.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.300
I don't want to get rich off this.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.980
Why won't you approve it?

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:54.699
It's normal to fail.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:55.579
Lucy?

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:56.819
What's wrong?

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.740
What happened?

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.220
Go, go, go!

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.819
What is it?

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:00.620
Call an ambulance!

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.660
How did this happen?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.740
Why did I have to argue with her?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.699
I just can't control my mouth.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.300
Doctor!

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.100
How is she?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.500
It's an intestinal obstruction, but surgery isn't possible yet.

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:21.620
We need to switch to...

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.540
...a conservative treatment plan.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.060
Why?

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.980
Her intestinal opening is severely narrowed.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.540
The surgical risk is too high.

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:29.660
We recommend conservative treatment first.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.420
Once her inflammation...

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.420
...is under control...

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:32.139
...we'll reassess.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:34.419
Can't you...

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.419
...use a surgical robot?

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.580
Surgical robots...

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:37.980
...their force control...

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.940
...is still not very stable.

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:39.980
They can easily cause...

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.139
...secondary injury to the patient.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.019
Thank you.

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:46.419
Unstable...

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:49.980
If it's unstable, put our sensor...

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.059
...inside the surgical robot.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.700
Then Lucy wouldn't have to suffer.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.100
Right?

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.899
Doing tech...

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:57.100
...requires innovation...

00:08:59.259 --> 00:08:59.899
...and practical application.

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:12.340
Wait a second.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.299
This algorithm of yours...

00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:15.340
...isn't it too conservative?

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:15.940
Look.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.620
The response is lagging.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.059
In a medical setting...

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.259
...you need real-time monitoring.

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:21.980
Didn't Boss He say...

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:23.700
...to go slower and steadier?

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:24.980
I also said...

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:26.340
...time waits for no one.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.740
Look at this.

00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:31.580
This competition in Shenzhen...

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.299
...has a prize bigger than past project grants...

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:34.100
...combined.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.860
If we win...

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:37.100
...Shenzhen will...

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:38.500
...give us a lot of support.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.940
2018...

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:41.779
...Shenzhen City...

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:43.379
...Science and Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition...

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:44.340
...Startup Project Group...

00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:45.820
...Third Prize Winner...

00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:47.100
Hu Xiaoyu...

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.299
Chen Jiawen.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.620
Project Title:

00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:51.340
Six-axis Force Sensor...

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.940
...Application in Medical Surgery.

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:55.580
Mom, you can't say that.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.059
What do you mean, the longer you study for a PhD, the poorer you get?

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.340
I know.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.299
I know Dad's health isn't great.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.340
Just give me two more years.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:04.980
Two years, okay?

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.940
The neighbors say, the neighbors say...

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.500
Why is it always what the neighbors say?

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.860
Well, Spider-Man also said...

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.460
With great power comes great responsibility.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.019
Dad.

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:13.740
In the future, on Lamma Island's list of famous people...

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.220
...right there...

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:15.539
...next to Fatt Gor's name...

00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:16.059
...will be your son's.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.500
Am I bragging?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.379
I brag every day.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.460
Dad, Mom.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.820
This time, us brothers...

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.740
...must pull off something big.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.500
Why did the power go out too?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.460
You didn't pay the electric bill, did you, bro?

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.620
Wasn't it your turn to pay?

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:32.740
Did you save the file?

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.100
Soon...

00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:36.100
...we received...

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.620
...Shenzhen's innovation support.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.620
We moved into the tech industrial park for free.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:40.820
It was darn impressive.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.100
But...

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.860
These 6mm thick little gadgets

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:53.580
always deform

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.500
during high-pressure testing.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.820
That's enough for general sensors,

00:10:57.419 --> 00:10:58.460
but for surgery,

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.899
it's a matter of life and death.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.259
Another two years have passed,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.019
and we have nothing to show for it.

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:20.139
I guessed you'd be here.

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:36.620
They all say

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:38.659
Shenzhen is the city of miracles.

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:41.659
Do you still believe in miracles?

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:44.659
Next time,

00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:45.860
it will definitely work.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.500
I believed that a year ago,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.139
but I don't believe it now.

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:56.259
Doing research

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.779
isn't about luck.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.019
How about this?

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:03.299
My treat tonight.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.059
Let's go karaoke.

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:06.019
Not in the mood.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.019
*Soft laughter*

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:15.100
*bringing me warmth*

00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:17.059
Cut it out.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:21.059
*You inject high-voltage joy into me*

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:22.019
Stop singing.

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:24.820
Let's go. Stop feeding the dog.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.220
Let's go.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.899
I said cut it out.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.059
I told you I'm not in the mood.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:29.100
Stop messing around, will you?

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:31.779
Why are you getting mad at me?

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.100
You think I'm not anxious?

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.940
What are you anxious about?

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.019
Don't you know?

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:36.299
We only have 1,000 yuan left.

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:38.299
I know that better than you.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.259
Here, take a look.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.500
I just borrowed 2,000 yuan from home.

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:42.539
My mom said,

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:43.659
if I borrow more, she'll disown me.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.179
What about you?

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:45.340
Amazing. Very amazing.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.179
What do you want me to do?

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.899
My dad is sick.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.820
My brother is getting married.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.940
My sister needs to go to school.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:50.940
So? Do you want me to go home

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.340
and keep asking them for money?

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.059
This is all I can do!

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.539
I can do the legwork. What about you?

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:01.299
Who are you looking down on? I'll do it.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.460
You dare sneak attack me?

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:13.539
You stealing my stuff?

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.740
If it's in my hand, it's mine.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.259
It's mine!

00:13:16.259 --> 00:13:16.980
Your skills are better than mine.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.659
You stay in the lab.

00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:18.299
I'll be in charge of making money.

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:18.899
It's settled then.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.419
No.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.179
Brothers shoulder it together.

00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:29.379
Okay.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.980
You said it.

00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:36.299
Brothers...

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.779
shoulder it together.

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:42.980
Together.

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:55.500
Buddy, stop rushing me.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.379
I'm almost there.

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:57.340
What's the rush?

00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:58.019
Xiaoyu.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.299
The technical problem you encountered...

00:13:59.299 --> 00:14:00.059
there's been a breakthrough.

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:00.899
Boss.

00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:02.259
There's a company in Shenzhen

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:02.940
that developed their own

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.139
metal 3D printer.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:05.220
It can make the sensor

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.179
casing strength

00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:07.500
reach 2,300 megapascals

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.220
without deforming.
