00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:47.200
Stella

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:48.840
What?

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.799
I want to ask you something.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.960
I knew it.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.439
Our Chairman...

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.759
...how many times has he been married?

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.880
Are you crazy?

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.679
The Chairman and his first wife were betrothed in the womb.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.520
They've been devoted to each other for decades.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.000
There's never been any gossip about him.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.560
Then tell me...

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.000
...is it possible...

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.040
...that Galileo was adopted?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.799
Or that Qixing was adopted?

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.239
How is that possible?

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:14.640
Those two...

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:15.719
...look so much alike.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:16.879
Do they?

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.239
I actually think...

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.959
...that little assistant looks more like him.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.560
What?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.280
When did you go blind?

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.200
I know a pretty good eye doctor.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.120
Watch your mouth!

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.120
Watch your mouth!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.719
They do look alike.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.079
Wen Pei'an.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.239
Galileo.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.239
What else?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.280
You little bastard!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.760
Bastard!

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.000
You just wait.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.520
We are truly in love.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.479
Why didn't you tell me?

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.240
I considered you a brother.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.919
And you actually...

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.039
...you're trying to date my sister?

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.599
I've always wanted to tell you.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.520
It's just that...

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.879
...there was never a good opportunity.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.319
When did you two get together?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.560
Don't laugh.

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.360
Actually...

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120
...back in high school...

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.159
...we had already entered each other's hearts.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.639
High school?

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.879
Eight years.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.400
So you had no time in eight years to tell me, is that it?

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.680
Ou Lu.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.120
I was fooled by your acting.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.039
Eight years.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.719
I was in a difficult position too.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.400
I hope...

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.560
...you can understand.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.360
Stop.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.159
One last question.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.199
When you first got close to me...

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.680
...did you want to be my brother...

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.800
...or did you want to date my sister?

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.719
I wanted both.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.599
No, wait.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.599
Think about it.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.520
Love and friendship...

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.560
...they don't conflict, right?

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.400
Right?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.919
You...

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.960
...are not worthy.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.520
I'm not worthy of being your good brother...

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.960
...or not worthy of being your good brother-in-law?

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.080
Brother-in-law.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.400
Don't let me hear those words.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:23.599
Then how about this...

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.240
From now on, think of me as two people.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:26.199
'Ou'...

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.639
...is your good brother.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.639
'Lu'...

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.639
...is your good brother-in-law.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.000
Brother-in-law.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.000
You...

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.520
President.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:41.159
This...

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.439
...this chair, is it...

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.439
...is there a problem with it? Yes, it is a bit uncomfortable.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.360
Yes, it is a bit uncomfortable.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.159
I'll have a new one custom-made for you.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.240
Is there something you need?

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.960
Xin Tong.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.120
It's like this.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.879
Our company's Four Seas Vitality live stream...

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.759
...will have its debut broadcast this afternoon.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.400
We need the President to attend.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.159
So...

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.840
...I'm here to coordinate the timing with both of you.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.800
The President attending?

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.759
I'd rather not.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.560
I still want...

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.120
...to keep a low profile.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.919
We won't reveal your identity.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.199
The President will attend as an ordinary employee.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:15.560
Well, I...

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.839
You have a very important meeting this afternoon.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.759
Right.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.639
That meeting...

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.360
...is very important.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.079
Perhaps you should first hear about the live stream content.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.279
During the live stream...

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.160
...we will have a Puppet Game.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.879
The President will play the role of the puppet.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.759
He will fulfill...

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.639
...any requests from the netizens.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.160
Any requests.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.240
Even unreasonable requests...

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.360
...can they be fulfilled?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.240
Of course.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.319
This makes it easier...

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.680
...for the company to get closer to young people.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.040
I think it's very necessary.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.720
I think this proposal is good.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.879
I think we can add some more...

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.480
...even more...

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.600
...impactful...

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.639
...creativity.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:54.839
Such as?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.600
Washing hair while doing a handstand.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.319
Taking off clothes for a costume change.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.800
Whatever is novel, we'll do it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.800
Excellent.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.000
President, do you agree?

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.439
Great!

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:05.120
With your strong support...

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.199
...I believe...

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.680
...Qixing's debut this afternoon...

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.279
...will definitely be a great success.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.160
So, I'd like to confirm once more...

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.240
...is the President's time okay?

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.040
My time is actually...

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.560
It's fine.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.399
I'll reschedule your time for you.

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.079
Perfect.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.560
I'm really looking forward to the live stream this afternoon.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.040
You...

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:22.519
...prepare well.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.160
See you in the live stream room.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.600
You're using your position for personal revenge.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.240
You made me lose face in front of so many netizens.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.879
And besides,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.040
Qixing has so many fans.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:37.959
You're underestimating me.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.079
Am I really that vindictive?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.160
It's all for the sake of work.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.959
Do your best.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:45.160
Good luck.

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:48.800
President.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.360
You're here.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.879
Let me briefly explain to you both.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.079
After the livestream starts,

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.240
Qixing will first give a brief introduction

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.120
to the overall Four Seas brand image.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.600
The next segment

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.480
will be the interaction

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.240
with the netizens.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.360
Let me check.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.680
One minute left.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.639
Livestream starting.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.360
Next up is the interactive segment.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.839
If you have any requests,

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:12.079
our esteemed President

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:14.000
will fulfill them one by one.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.000
Let's welcome

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.800
the handsome Four Seas President.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.959
Secretary Ou.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:24.360
Where are you going?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.160
Darn it.

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:26.360
Darn it.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.839
President.

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:29.920
Where are you going?

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.120
It's almost time for

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.680
your brilliant performance segment.

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:38.639
You

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.160
knew all along.

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.000
What do you think?

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.879
After you.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:45.040
Galileo.

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.800
Did you snitch?

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:56.959
It was you, wasn't it?

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:58.199
Dear brother.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.759
To demonstrate that Four Seas

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.120
listens to customer needs,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.120
we'll randomly select viewer comments.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.879
All your requests,

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.000
our Four Seas President

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.199
will fulfill them one by one.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.160
A user benefit is a discount.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.240
We hope the President

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.680
can perform an amazing dance.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.279
Welcome to

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.480
Four Seas.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.120
Xin Tong.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.120
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:06.439
I didn't, boss.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.360
What?

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:08.839
Dancing,

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:09.639
handstands,

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.279
rapping...

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.160
These segments

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.839
were all your idea, weren't they?

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.160
You even said it was a good idea.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:17.519
Why are you blaming me now, boss?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.639
That last part worked really well.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:19.920
The traffic is skyrocketing.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.560
It's effective.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.079
I'm going to check around.

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:30.199
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.560
I was afraid...

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.200
Afraid you'd find out

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.200
I was that darn bastard.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.440
Afraid our relationship would become distant.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.120
Afraid you'd know I like you.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.919
Afraid of what?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.919
Afraid I'd make exorbitant demands?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.639
Afraid I'd extort money from you?

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:54.039
That's my privacy.

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:56.000
I have the right not to tell you.

00:08:56.759 --> 00:08:57.559
Fine.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.360
Well then, next up

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:01.399
there are still many segments.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.200
You need to

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.279
keep it up.

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:06.279
And also...

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:11.399
What a sin.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.879
Netizen "Li Mama Who's Not a Mom"

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.159
hopes the President can

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:21.240
perform a heartfelt confession.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.799
Even the script is written.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.440
Am I supposed to say this to a user?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.960
How about

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.360
having our specialist Xin Tong

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.639
help perform it with you?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.399
Brother.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.960
Seize this opportunity.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.960
Advance to attack,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960
retreat to defend.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.559
Let's get started.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.000
Actually, during this time,

00:09:58.159 --> 00:10:00.639
even though we've had our bumps,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.759
I don't know how you feel,

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:06.559
but I think I'm falling a bit.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:11.759
Under the watch of these hundred thousand netizens,

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:13.840
I want to tell you:

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:22.440
I love you.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.480
I just took a look at the script.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.000
This

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.159
"Frog Prank" segment...

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.399
Did you swap it out?

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:36.960
Of course not.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.320
It was my direct supervisor,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.480
Qixing.

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:43.120
She just genuinely wanted to set you two up.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.799
Please thank her for her kindness.

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.399
But between Wen Pei'an and me,

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:50.519
it's impossible.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.120
He,

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:56.120
a well-bred man,

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:57.600
has never been involved with

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.320
an ordinary girl like me.

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:01.720
After spending time together,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.360
it's easy to develop an illusion.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.679
And this illusion

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.440
is just hormones at play.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:10.759
It's not real.

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:11.840
It's fake.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:13.799
It will always be fake.

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:15.600
So,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.960
I'm counting on you.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.399
You can't just mess with me alone.

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:25.200
It's because you're outstanding.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.600
Secretary Ou.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:30.519
Hello.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.320
You don't seem to welcome me.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:10.960
How would internet celebrity Miss Coco dare?

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.360
We can't afford to offend you.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.320
As the boss,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.919
I naturally keep an eye on my employees.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.080
What's going on?

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:29.159
My account was hacked.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:32.440
Come on, come on.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.320
Today, let me introduce a new classmate.

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:34.679
Come on.

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:35.159
Classmate,

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:35.759
introduce yourself.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.919
I'm Ou Lu.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.559
Good, everyone, welcome him.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.799
Hello.
