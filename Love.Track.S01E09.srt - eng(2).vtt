(Jeon Hae Jin)

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.563
(Yang Dae Hyeok)

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:53.985
Yes?

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.654
I'm from the real estate office.

00:00:58.156 --> 00:01:00.525
Hello, ma'am.
We'd like to take a look at the place.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.129
Please come in.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.098
Perfect timing. You're both here together.

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:10.068
This couple here is newly married too,
and they won the housing lottery.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.903
So the place came on the market
in a real rush.

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:15.807
Even though it's a villa,
listings like this are rare.

00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:18.543
- Yes, come on in.
- Please come in.

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:20.645
We'll take a look at the master bedroom.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:25.116
Did they open up the wall?

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.687
This place has such great energy.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:30.188
You know, the land itself has to be good.

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:32.624
That's how couples get along better.

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:33.491
Isn't that so?

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.062
Well, yes.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.966
- The bathroom...
- Yes, you should check that carefully.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:45.103
The bathroom's spacious, isn't it?

00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:47.639
Do you think it's okay?

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:48.707
It's not bad.

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:52.277
Excuse me.

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:54.112
Give it some thought and give me a call.

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:55.480
- We'll be in touch.
- Yes.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.215
- Thank you.
- Take care.

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:02.687
Those two would be perfect.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.624
But miss, you should smile a bit.

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:09.261
If the vibe feels off,
the house won't sell easily.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.262
What do you mean?

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.597
I didn't mean anything by it.

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:15.867
Why? Did you two fight this morning?

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:19.037
When we move out of this house,
we're getting divorced.

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:26.645
Right.
I was expecting clients at the office.

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:30.315
Well then,

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:32.183
I'll try to get back to you
as soon as possible.

00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:42.193
(Love's Grace Period)

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:48.500
(Real Estate)

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.269
Life never goes exactly as planned.

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:56.308
After winning what everyone called
a jackpot, the newlywed housing lottery,

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.779
we decided not to love each other anymore.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.984
One month until the apartment move-in.

00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:08.453
On that day,

00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:10.989
we decide to get divorced.

00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:29.441
I'll take the car today.
I need to stop by somewhere.

00:03:30.575 --> 00:03:31.476
Here.

00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:35.113
Ms. Won.

00:03:35.947 --> 00:03:37.449
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:40.919
It's nice seeing you two
come to work together every day.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.954
Then you should hurry up
and get married too.

00:03:42.954 --> 00:03:45.891
At least set me up on a blind date
before saying that.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.360
Did that last blind date not go well?

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:50.695
He never called for a second date.

00:03:54.432 --> 00:03:55.367
Yoo Ri.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:58.870
Yoo Ri.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:03.942
But why are you still living
in that house?

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.512
You're staying married
until move-in anyway,

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:08.747
so you don't really need to live together.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.682
He has nowhere else to go.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.220
He took an early severance payout
and put it all into the subscription,

00:04:16.187 --> 00:04:17.222
and he still has loans.

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:19.190
That's what's strange.

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:20.992
I mean, if you're getting divorced,

00:04:20.992 --> 00:04:23.361
who gives their ex-wife
the house and money?

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:25.864
Does he have some hidden agenda?

00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:28.333
It's not like that.

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.334
Divorce.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:32.504
I've been through it, so I know.
You have to be decisive.

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:34.506
When people are cornered,
they all act the same.

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:39.044
What are you, some kind of know-it-all?

00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:43.148
I'm not a know-it-all,
but I do know a thing or two.

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.985
You don't still have feelings for him,
do you?

00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:17.148
I told you to do it separately.

00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:18.450
I'll do it while I'm at it.

00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:21.386
Take that with you.

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:23.989
Stop giving me things like this
all the time.

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:25.624
It's just a habit.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:29.060
It makes more sense
for you to use the car, right?

00:05:29.961 --> 00:05:30.962
I don't mind.

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:33.565
How can you not mind?

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:37.369
Right. I'll use it tomorrow.

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:38.536
I'm going to look at rooms during the day.

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:40.939
I'll go with you.

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:45.911
Let's just get it over with.

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:48.813
I want to stop talking about this.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.385
Why? Did he say something?

00:05:55.253 --> 00:05:56.388
He wants to see you.

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:00.892
Then bring him home.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.731
Bring him here?

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:09.634
Yeah.

00:06:10.468 --> 00:06:11.303
Okay.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.405
How much are the vitamins?

00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:15.073
It's fine. It's nothing.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.911
Don't call everything even like that.

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:33.124
Come on in.

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:35.827
This is the room.

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:53.144
Why won't the window close?

00:06:53.144 --> 00:06:55.180
It's just stuck for now.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.748
I'll fix it before you move in.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.922
Are you serious?
You really plan to live there?

00:07:04.422 --> 00:07:05.657
The window doesn't even close.

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:08.293
It's close to my workplace.

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:25.310
Hello?

00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:27.646
Yeah.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:30.882
Yeah.

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:32.817
No, I haven't eaten yet.

00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:34.886
Yeah.

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.558
Okay, I'll call you back.

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:56.775
It's nice seeing you talk so much
after a long time.

00:07:58.243 --> 00:07:59.077
You're lying.

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:01.513
I mean it.

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.350
Just stay home.

00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:07.152
That place isn't right.

00:08:35.313 --> 00:08:36.514
Hey.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.784
You didn't have to bring anything.

00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:41.620
How could I do that?

00:08:42.787 --> 00:08:43.555
Thanks.

00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:46.124
- Come in.
- Okay.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.232
Hello.

00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:57.102
Would you like some coffee?

00:08:57.569 --> 00:08:58.770
Yes, thank you.

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.420
You said you wanted to see me?

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:17.188
Yes.

00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:20.058
I'll be straightforward.

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:22.327
To be honest, the fact that you two
are still living together...

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:24.829
makes me very uncomfortable.

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:27.899
I know you've sorted things out
between you two,

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.167
but it still weighs on my mind.

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:31.903
You know how it looks.

00:09:31.903 --> 00:09:35.173
Who would understand this situation?
Right?

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:37.842
So instead,

00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:40.211
I think it would be better
if Yoo Ri moved into my place.

00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:42.514
That's not what we talked about.

00:09:44.015 --> 00:09:47.986
We have a lot of complicated issues
to sort through.

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:49.454
I heard you're moving
into a semi-basement.

00:09:49.454 --> 00:09:51.756
That would make Yoo Ri uncomfortable too.

00:09:52.524 --> 00:09:55.560
As long as you both secure
separate places, isn't that enough?

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:58.997
And we are seeing each other now.

00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:01.433
You're using separate rooms, right?

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.335
Min Gi.

00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:05.470
I just want things to be clear.

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.177
Yoo Ri cherishes this carpet.

00:10:13.511 --> 00:10:14.446
I see.

00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:16.815
This carpet?

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:21.886
I'm sorry, Min Gi,

00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:25.056
but we're not divorced yet.

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:37.235
Okay.

00:10:42.374 --> 00:10:43.642
Call me once everything's settled.

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:45.844
I'll leave now.

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:02.327
Don't you need to go after him?

00:11:02.327 --> 00:11:04.629
Why would I? He was right.

00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:07.232
You're unbelievable.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:09.134
Is the carpet really that important?

00:11:09.467 --> 00:11:10.502
Of course, it is.

00:11:17.909 --> 00:11:19.578
Could you not make this about me?

00:12:33.318 --> 00:12:34.219
Hee Chan.

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:36.121
You can't do that, okay?

00:12:36.788 --> 00:12:38.890
Dad, Hee Chan bought a Benz.

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:42.561
Should I tell Mom to buy you one as well?

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:45.230
I want a Porsche.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.765
Porsche? Okay.

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:48.033
I told you not to do that.

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:52.070
I told you not to.

00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:05.584
Hey.

00:13:09.087 --> 00:13:10.622
Do you want to have pork belly?

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.435
There's this Chinese drama I'm watching.

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:02.707
I saw. You've been watching a lot.

00:14:04.242 --> 00:14:06.645
It's weird how people are flying around
in that drama.

00:14:08.246 --> 00:14:09.714
They're not people. They're monsters.

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:43.648
I bought this near the house.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:47.018
That place is run by the son now.

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:50.589
Yeah, the owner changed.

00:14:54.092 --> 00:14:55.360
How many episodes are there?

00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:57.729
One hundred twenty.

00:14:59.831 --> 00:15:00.999
If you watch it all, a year will pass.

00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:10.642
- It's fun.
- With all that killing.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:16:00.792
(Application for Confirmation of Intent
for Mutual Divorce)

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.538
We're using separate rooms.

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.241
Should I take a photo and send it?

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:23.048
I'm full. It's been a while.

00:16:23.348 --> 00:16:24.215
Yeah.

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:26.651
I ate too much earlier too.

00:16:27.552 --> 00:16:28.687
You really did eat a lot.

00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:32.190
I need to feed it.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.625
I already did earlier.

00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:36.428
Yeah, thanks.

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:45.704
That guy.

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:49.674
You're seeing him
because you like him, right?

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:54.412
I hope it's because you like him.

00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:57.882
Go all in...

00:17:00.118 --> 00:17:01.453
in doing whatever makes you happy.

00:17:08.693 --> 00:17:09.895
That's what I'm doing now.

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.331
And that's why everything's a mess.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:25.277
Can we sleep together tonight?

00:17:38.823 --> 00:17:40.992
Hey, Yoo Ri,
when are you ever going to shower?

00:17:41.726 --> 00:17:43.762
I'm in a really good mood right now.
Don't interrupt me.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.431
- Want me to let you shower?
- What are you doing?

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:48.199
Hey.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.035
Honey.

00:17:50.368 --> 00:17:52.370
- Even my hair smells nice.
- Let me smell it.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.906
No, don't. Don't smell it.

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:08.653
What if...

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.024
we lived like this?

00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:37.482
Get some more sleep.

00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:45.850
If I don't hear from you,
I'll take it as us breaking up.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.186
(Min Gi)

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:53.124
(A voice message has arrived.)

00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:58.029
Hello.

00:19:58.029 --> 00:20:02.400
The remaining balance for Pad Nine Park
View hasn't been received by the deadline.

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:06.571
If the remaining balance is not paid
within the designated move-in period,

00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:07.505
the contract will be terminated...

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:12.110
Hey, Yoo Ri.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.044
Won Yoo Ri.

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:17.649
Hey, wait.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.623
- Just a second.
- You said you'd pay the balance.

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.958
I was so overwhelmed,
I got the schedule mixed up.

00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:29.327
Is there anything
more important than this?

00:20:29.794 --> 00:20:31.229
Okay, I'll transfer it right now.

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:32.597
That fixes it, right?

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:35.100
Ji Hoo.

00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:39.070
Is this house really important to you?

00:20:42.073 --> 00:20:43.141
Of course it is.

00:20:46.177 --> 00:20:47.679
Can we stop having this conversation?

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:48.546
Yeah.

00:20:49.547 --> 00:20:51.283
That's why we're getting divorced.

00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:54.352
We tried, didn't we?

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:57.789
I know this is the house
you've wanted forever.

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:59.958
That's why I'm dealing with loans
and interest and all that.

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.026
Exactly.

00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:03.795
That's why I said I wanted to give it up.

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:05.797
But you said we should at least
keep the house.

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:07.766
We have to. How can we just give it up?

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.335
Pay it or don't. Do whatever you want.

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.038
What's the point of any of it anyway?

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:14.940
None of it matters anymore.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.045
It was supposed to be the house
we'd live in together.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.182
The three of us.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.958
But you were never there.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.391
I'm going to go work out.

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:08.693
I think I'm going to have nightmares.

00:22:09.527 --> 00:22:10.328
Again?

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.167
Try to get some sleep.

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:18.937
And stop crying. You're exhausted.

00:22:42.994 --> 00:22:45.297
Is our house coming along okay?

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:47.566
You like it that much?

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:49.734
You're basically the site manager.

00:22:49.734 --> 00:22:51.937
Hello. You're here for inspection again?

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:52.837
Hello.

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:02.113
It'd be great
if all these leaves were money, right?

00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:03.181
Yeah.

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:04.549
Let's take a picture too.

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:06.751
Careful.

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:12.857
That relaxed, rich-person look.
You know that, right?

00:23:12.857 --> 00:23:13.792
Okay, trust me.

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:17.028

00:24:56.928 --> 00:24:58.830
Hello, ma'am.

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.633
Yes, you've been well, right?

00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:09.274
He asked not to contact you
under any circumstances.

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:14.312
The prenatal insurance cancellation
was handled by your husband at the time,

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:15.747
so everything was processed properly.

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.817
He cried so much...

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.820
that I was honestly worried
something might happen to him.

00:25:58.156 --> 00:25:59.157
Where did you go?

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.126
To wash the car.

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.395
You washed it yesterday.

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:08.433
How...

00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:11.469
did we end up like this?

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:16.541
Our car is probably the cleanest in Seoul.

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.477
All we do is wash it, day after day.

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:23.815
Without even knowing
what condition the car is in.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.657
Why don't you ask?

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:36.895
You know I cried.

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:39.898
Did something happen?

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:42.000
You're asking what happened?

00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:44.769
Ji Hoo,

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.174
why do you go somewhere else to cry?

00:26:51.876 --> 00:26:53.311
You tell me to bring my boyfriend home?

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:57.048
You tell me to take the house too?

00:26:58.516 --> 00:26:59.517
Is that even possible for you?

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.688
How does everything work out for you?

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.491
Seriously,

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:09.494
why do you always say it doesn't matter?
It's infuriating.

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:12.464
I'm the one messing everything up
right now.

00:27:12.898 --> 00:27:14.132
I'm a wreck.

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.268
Acting like nothing matters,

00:27:16.268 --> 00:27:18.036
wasn't it actually you who gave up first?

00:27:29.915 --> 00:27:30.916
Yoo Ri.

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:36.621
I...

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:39.524
I lost you too.

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.229
It's still so vivid.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.767
Every night you saw me falling apart,

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:52.637
you went to work out at dawn
like you were escaping.

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:53.838
Seeing that,

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:56.474
"Is he actually some kind of sociopath?"

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:01.112
Yeah.

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:03.848
You must've felt suffocated.

00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:07.552
You must've been struggling too.

00:28:09.321 --> 00:28:11.590
If at least you could breathe a little,
that was good.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.029
I thought things would get better
that way.

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:21.866
But...

00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:25.003
you were running away.

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:28.773
The man who wouldn't even change
a bathroom light bulb...

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.742
no matter how many months I asked,

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:32.744
suddenly doing laundry
and buying vitamins?

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:35.080
Why now?

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:38.917
Because that's all I can do.

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.587
You just...

00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:46.024
did laundry
because you didn't want to face it.

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:49.027
The car wash,
the interim payment, everything.

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:50.028
I was scared.

00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:58.737
I was even scared to say I was scared.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.976
I didn't know how to say it to you.

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:09.681
I thought I'd ruin everything.

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:12.817
I was afraid you'd regret all of it.

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:16.388
I regret it.

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.861
I should've said I needed you.

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:28.233
That I really hated you.

00:29:31.036 --> 00:29:32.671
That I was in so much pain.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:35.707
We should've cried together.

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:39.811
I thought I couldn't fall apart.

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.747
That scared me the most.

00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:44.516
You said...

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:49.120
you were scared.

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:51.723
Then...

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:54.759
why did you leave me alone with that fear?

00:30:14.246 --> 00:30:15.313
I'm sorry.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.949
Now,

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.387
I want to stop hating you.

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:27.359
I hate myself for blaming you...

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.694
all the time.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.965
I hate that the most.

00:30:41.473 --> 00:30:42.507
I'm sorry.

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:47.045
Not "I'm sorry."

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:50.849
Can we...

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:54.853
talk about something else,

00:30:58.123 --> 00:30:59.324
from now on?

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:20.011
Fall was short,

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:23.682
and we couldn't keep postponing
this moment forever.

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:27.485
Only after the crushing burden
of the interim payment...

00:31:27.786 --> 00:31:30.789
and the resentment between us
finally ended...

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:33.525
were we able to cry together.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.429
Only after crying for a long time...

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:39.331
did we...

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:42.434
accept a new season.

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:07.792
It's been a while since we changed cars,
but there's not a single scratch.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.694
We bought it because it's sturdy.

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.031
You said an SUV was your dream car.

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.302
I lied. I just wanted to look good
in front of you.

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.070
Then what?

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:21.406
A Ferrari?

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:24.809
Guess I was fooled.

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:36.187
After washing the car,

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.924
I think I'm getting hungry too.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.572
It's an apartment,
but you don't have much furniture.

00:32:57.943 --> 00:32:59.077
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.820
Mom, Dad must've farted.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.188
It smells like ginkgo.

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:13.091
What did you say, Yeol?

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:15.360
Come here.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.865
We broke up,

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:22.500
and the apartment remained.

00:33:23.635 --> 00:33:24.970
And one more thing.

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:27.739
The farther we drifted apart,

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:31.009
the more we wanted to keep smiling,
for longer.

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:33.445
That was...

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:36.514
the unconditional feeling
we managed to protect...

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.184
at the end of that fall.

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.103
Even now, sometimes,

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.405
there are moments
when I still like you, honey.

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:04.910
I know.

00:34:31.625 --> 00:34:33.625
