00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.412
{\an8}The Asian artist chart has been released.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:42.250
{\an8}Just like last year, Korean artists
have once again made it onto the chart.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.127
{\an8}And this one too.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.087
{\an8}Just 3,000 won more, please.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.798
{\an8}The Asia Artist Chart compiles…

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.343
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:56.389
{\an8}This makes the news even more promising.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:58.683
{\an8}Next up,

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:02.479
{\an8}Gold Boys' Ra-ik caught up
in a dating rumor

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.649
{\an8}with a trainee from the same label.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:12.363
{\an8}The agency remains silent.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.408
{\an8}Some reports say
the two first met years ago…

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.832
GOLD BOYS' RA-IK,
RUMORED TO BE DATING A TRAINEE?

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.921
{\an8}WHO IS HIS RUMORED LOVE?

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:49.484
Attorney Maeng, did you eat?

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:55.406
I got you some porridge.
Try to have some later.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:56.783
Okay?

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:27.397
Ra-ik denied the rumor!
Hurry, turn on Entertainment Special!

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.319
Gold Boys Ra-ik denied dating rumors.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:38.116
Through his agency, he stated
that they're just close friends.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.036
Saying work matters
more than dating for him right now,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.997
he reassured fans.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.417
- As baseless speculations continued…
- He said no.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.085
Ra-ik's agency, Goldie Entertainment

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.337
- took a firm stance…
- She's just a friend.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.216
…declaring they will take serious measures

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.843
against the spread of false information.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.989
Let's go, come on.

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:02.825
It's recording, right?

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:07.121
- What?
- The dashcam, I wish you'd turned it off.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.355
I said not to call me on promotion day!
You ruined everything…

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.612
What's going on there?

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.740
Who's she? You know her?

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.535
Yeah, she's the one
Ra-ik had a dating rumor with.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:48.329
What?

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.624
The one that had you crying
for three days straight

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.043
without eating or sleeping?

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.297
That's her?

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.008
That jerk.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.594
Saying he'd never date
and that he only loves his fans,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.888
and now look at him.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.690
So that's why you've got that long face?

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.942
What long face?

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.654
Stop talking nonsense and keep a lookout.
If anyone sees us, we're screwed.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.489
See? I told you.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.075
Never trust anyone
who lives with makeup on.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:30.580
He's a grown man,
no way he's never dated at his age.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.667
So why'd you give him your whole heart?

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.674
I mean, I didn't want you to get hurt.

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.095
Why would I be hurt? He's just a client.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.642
My feelings… don't matter.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.151
Why did you even come there?

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.196
- Because I was worried about you.
- No.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.782
You were worried about yourself, not me.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:09.786
Why? Were you nervous
because I met a prosecutor?

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.454
Afraid I might say something?

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.747
What?

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.629
The closer you try to get to me,

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.507
the more I can't help but doubt you.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.051
You don't want
to be tangled up in this, right?

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:27.929
So don't come looking for me again.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:33.226
Stay away from me, completely.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.854
I saw Jae-hee that night.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.649
What?

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.027
On my way home after meeting you,

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:46.906
I saw him going to the dorm.

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:51.911
But the news says he was at the hospital.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.081
But I know what I saw.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.084
He was there that night.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.336
Definitely.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.887
Could you give us a moment?

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.192
I think you need to explain this.

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:25.153
Later.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.281
That night, after you left the store
and went up the trail…

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.329
you went to meet Hong Hye-joo, right?

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.831
How do you know her name?

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.332
Answer my question first.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.500
I asked how you know that?

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.419
What matters isn't how I found out,

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.379
it's how I didn't know until now.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.841
I told you,
you can't hide anything from me.

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:50.219
But I faced the prosecutor
without knowing this?

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.931
She has nothing to do with this case,
so there was no reason to mention her.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:58.144
Do you realize how cornered you are
because of that reckless choice?

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:02.732
The prosecutors already suspect
your whereabouts that night.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:07.111
- They'll soon find out that you two met--
- Hye-joo has nothing to do with this case.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.907
I don't want her getting dragged
into this because of me.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:13.451
I need to go somewhere.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.204
I'll explain everything when I get back.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:17.997
But before that,

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.791
please take her home.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.211
Could you please?

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.549
Fine. I'll do that.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.775
Hey, wait! Hold on!

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.656
Come on, I just bought that last month!

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.830
This is the footage we got from the taxi.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.794
From just a quick look,
something feels really off and sticky.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:10.841
Looks like that woman has some
serious grudge against Do Ra-ik, right?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.010
Have you confirmed her identity?

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.054
We already checked the car.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.182
But it turned out to be a company car.

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:22.478
Then we can just ask the company
to confirm the real owner.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.021
We did.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.567
But the thing is…

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.571
The car belongs to the Imhwa Group.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.115
The Imhwa Group?

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:47.461
But is it okay not to tell her
that Ra-ik is staying here?

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:51.507
That's…

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.719
the client's private matter.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.097
Get out, I need to get back to the office.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.016
All right, then.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.249
What?

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.459
Are you okay?

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.918
Why wouldn't I be okay?

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.920
No, that look on your face--

00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:30.921
Chung-jae.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.508
Don't ever talk to me
about my feelings again.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:38.971
I'm not some incompetent person
who lets emotions ruin my work, am I?

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.850
No dashcam, no CCTV, no messages, nothing.
So what are you going to do?

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:45.728
What did she say earlier?

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.897
That night, when the two were talking…

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.691
A taxi suddenly pulled up, so we split.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.068
Which means…

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.570
So there might be a witness?

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:55.613
Correct.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.700
Go get that taxi dashcam, now.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:00.743
Right now?

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.913
- Come on, you're joking.
- I'm not.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.625
No excuses, make sure to find it today.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.345
How am I supposed to find that?

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.013
I said I'm not talking to you!

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.516
I'll deal with CEO Geum myself!

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:26.560
He's still deciding.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.396
Just wait a bit more, okay?

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.148
Please. I know exactly what he's planning.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:34.360
He's just gonna leave us hanging
until the contract ends

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.612
and then toss us aside without a renewal.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.907
I'll leave on my own before that.

00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:41.409
Jae-hee.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.911
Are you leaving the group?

00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:46.372
- I have to look out for myself.
- Jae-hee!

00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:48.749
People forget fast.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:52.044
In a few years,
even the tiny offers we get will be gone.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.214
You should hurry
and find your own path too.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.633
I don't even have one.

00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:00.553
You know I've got nowhere to go. I…

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:08.894
- Ra-ik!
- What? Didn't you change the door code?

00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:11.230
Manager.

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.983
How long was Jae-hee hospitalized
after the concert?

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.067
What?

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.403
Were you two really together
for two full days?

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.822
Why are you asking?

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:23.200
Hey, Choi Jae-hee,

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.286
look me in the eyes and tell me.

00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:26.912
The day Woo-seong ended up like that,

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:30.249
- are you sure you were at the hospital?
- What do you mean?

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:31.750
Answer me!

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.002
Where were you that day?

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.503
Jae-hee was at the hospital.

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.384
You know that he was hospitalized with me.

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:44.763
Are you trying
to pin everything on me now?

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:45.764
Stop it.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.266
Let's go out first.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:48.684
I know!

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:49.977
I saw it.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.520
I know why you killed him!

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.646
Yeah?

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.565
Then say it! Why would I kill him?

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.650
Why would I kill him?

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:59.236
Hey, get out. Let's just get out!

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.571
Should I say it?

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.078
- Let go! I said let go!
- Stop it!

00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:12.625
How did you even get here?
You came all the way here like this?

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:14.793
What if someone sees you--

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:17.838
Manager, are you sure that
Jae-hee was at the hospital that day?

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.049
I was at the office then, so I don't know.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.009
Why do you keep asking that?

00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.303
Where are you staying now?

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:25.930
I heard about your place.

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:27.848
- If you have nowhere to go--
- Then what?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.935
Can you live with a murder suspect?

00:13:58.587 --> 00:13:59.630
Right.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.217
It was around that time.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:13.143
When the controversy
over his poor attitude on stage began…

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:20.276
the company covered it up,
saying it was food poisoning, but…

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.737
The group we love hearing every day
and can't stop thinking about!

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.866
Welcome, Gold Boys!

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.451
We are gold! Gold Boys!

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.661
Great to have you here!

00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:34.540
Ra-ik, we heard
you put a lot of effort into this album.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:38.794
Is there a track you made
or is there a song that you like most?

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:46.010
It wasn't the body that was hurt.
It was his heart.

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.475
Because he lost the one

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.061
he loved.

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:06.155
See?

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.241
What's with her today?

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.409
I don't know.

00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:13.454
She's been like that since she came back
from the prosecutor's office.

00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:16.373
Looks like Kwak Byung-gyun
really grilled her.

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:20.169
Guess even the great Attorney Maeng
is powerless against him.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:25.758
But doesn't she look a little sad?

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:29.511
Exactly, like someone who just got dumped.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:30.554
Isn't it obvious?

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:34.350
It's because if she loses the case,
she'll lose all her success fees.

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:39.855
Get it together, Maeng Se-na!
He's just a client.

00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:42.942
Don't you know
feelings are like a wild horse?

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:47.863
A horse running wild… you cut its throat
before it throws you off.

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.617
And fine, he can fall in love.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:56.038
At an age when testosterone
is at its peak… Dating?

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.998
Of course, he should.

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.959
Idols are human too.

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.135
But he said he wasn't dating.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:14.765
On Entertainment Exclusive,
July 16th, 2022, he clearly said…

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.940
No one deceived me,

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.528
but somehow I feel deceived.

00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:28.862
And still…

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:34.118
When he had to deny his love…

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:38.455
what did it feel like?

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.918
Was he sad, hurt?

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:45.879
Or lonely?

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.676
In the end, all I do
is worry about you first.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.435
Where can I possibly put

00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:02.646
a heart that feels like this?

00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:14.742
Attorney Maeng, did you see this?

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.910
It just came out as breaking news.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.291
DO RA-IK SECRET LATE-NIGHT RENDEZVOUS
AFTER MURDER SUSPECT QUESTIONING

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.923
Isn't this in front of
the prosecutor's office?

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:33.260
Looks like it was taken from really close.

00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:50.110
Yes.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.321
Are you with Hye-joo now?

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:55.282
I took her home earlier.
Where are you now?

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.910
An article just came out, Hye-joo and I…

00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:01.413
- I saw it. And actually--
- We need that article removed right now.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.457
Isn't there any legal way to block it?

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.002
We can request a correction,
but that requires some procedures.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.670
I'll look into what we can do first--

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.006
I don't have time for procedures now.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.760
So you're saying,
there's no way to block it. Got it.

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.387
What? Got what?

00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:31.860
Ye-sol, find out where the outlet
that posted this article is and call me.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.612
- As soon as possible.
- Yes.

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:39.743
That's Hong Hye-joo, right?

00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:43.413
What is this?
What is my sister-in-law doing here?

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:44.331
I knew it.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.041
Knew what?

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.169
Gi-wook, did you know everything?

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:50.546
What do you mean?

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:54.383
Knowing Chairman Hong,
he wouldn't set up a meeting himself.

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:57.970
The truth is, your sister-in-law
asked you to, didn't she?

00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:00.514
Well… Huh?

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:02.349
Do you realize what you did?

00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:04.893
You set up a private meeting

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.396
between a key person in the case
and the lead prosecutor.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.565
Very intentionally.

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:12.151
- What do you mean?
- Your sister-in-law, Hong Hye-joo!

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:17.239
She's deeply tied
to Do Ra-ik's murder case.

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:20.492
- What?
- I won't let this slide.

00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:25.622
You are going to pay for treating
a prosecutor of Korea like nothing.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.166
Keep that in mind.

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:31.044
Hey!

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.881
What are you talking about? Hey!

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.151
What?

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.613
Long time no see, Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:01.325
What brings
a top star like you to this dump?

00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:02.743
Take that article down, now.

00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:04.203
No, I don't want to.

00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:06.705
Articles are just like words.

00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:08.373
Once said, you can't take them back.

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:09.791
I said take it down.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.669
Wow, still soft about her.

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:15.464
Does she know?
That you're still this hung up on her?

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:16.882
Shut your mouth.

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:18.342
Why not kneel and beg me?

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.762
Who knows, I might let it slide,
just like last time.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:25.641
Go ahead, release whatever you want.

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.893
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:29.228
Sit down.

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.521
Sure. You didn't do anything shameful.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.482
She did.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.027
That Hong Hye-joo, or whatever,

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.364
she's the one who got cut
from the debut lineup recently, right?

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:43.909
Does she relieve stress by dating around?

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:46.245
How many guys does she go through?

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:55.837
Hey, that won't change anything.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.839
Figure out how to shut me up.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.312
She has no idea, right?

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:15.148
What you lost because of her.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:21.113
You signed an unfair contract for her
and even turn against your mother over it.

00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.907
It's all in the past.
Why are you bringing it up again?

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:26.493
You really don't know why? It was you.

00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:28.662
You tattled to the company
that I took money.

00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:30.289
Thanks a lot.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:32.457
For making me write
trashy tabloids in this dump.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:33.834
It wasn't me.

00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:34.918
It doesn't matter.

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:37.379
I'm about to drop a real bomb anyway.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.049
I can't believe I didn't know back then.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:45.178
That Hong Hye-joo
was Imhwa Group's hidden daughter.

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:49.391
Well, now that I finally know the truth,
it's time to really dig in.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.352
The follow-up article will be incredible.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:56.023
"An ex-lover tied to a murder case."

00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:02.154
I warned you before. If you touch
anyone around me, I won't let it slide.

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.531
If this happens one more time,

00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:06.950
even I don't know what I'll do.

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.744
What are you going to do?

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.538
Did you forget? I'm a murder suspect.

00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:13.999
Keep messing with me, and…

00:22:14.082 --> 00:22:16.460
Stop! Enough!

00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:19.129
How dare you threaten an active reporter?

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:20.922
- I swear, I'll--
- That's enough.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.758
Enough? That bastard murderer is…

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.804
These were taken
long before Kang Woo-seong's incident.

00:22:28.388 --> 00:22:32.142
From outside his house
to the makeup shop, the car…

00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:34.728
You tracked every part
of his private movements.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:39.649
Even him going to the bathroom?

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.110
This is legitimate reporting.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:44.321
Don't you know?
Celebrities are public figures.

00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:48.200
Their privacy can be restricted by law.

00:22:48.283 --> 00:22:50.660
- Reporters have the right to cover that!
- Right?

00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:54.081
- You tear apart my life with what right?
- You're right.

00:22:54.164 --> 00:22:57.334
Public figures
may have diminished privacy,

00:22:57.417 --> 00:23:00.087
but Hong Hye-joo is a private individual.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.882
Publishing her personal information
without consent may amount to defamation.

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:11.431
And I'll hold you responsible

00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:13.850
if your so-called reporting
can't be justified.

00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:28.406
This is where you rushed off to?

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:33.578
To stand in front of a tabloid reporter
and proudly say you're a murder suspect?

00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:37.082
- No, I just--
- I am your lawyer.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:41.211
A lawyer has to know everything you do,
or even what you might do,

00:23:41.294 --> 00:23:44.005
so we can prepare for it,

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.882
but you tell me nothing.

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.801
You acted on your own.

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:49.469
You even lied to me.

00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:53.682
How am I supposed to trust
and defend you now?

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.225
I wasn't trying to lie--

00:23:55.308 --> 00:23:58.145
Hiding something is lying.

00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:04.025
Then…

00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:07.904
I guess my whole life has been a lie.

00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:10.365
It's me, Hye-joo.

00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:12.325
I'm back in Korea.

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:14.744
Why aren't you answering?

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.038
I want to see you.

00:24:21.585 --> 00:24:24.171
HONG HYE-JOO

00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:36.099
I've had

00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:40.520
to live my whole life
hiding everything about myself.

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:46.943
It's all in the past now, Hye-joo.

00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:53.074
I got it, so please just stop.

00:24:53.783 --> 00:24:56.369
Ra-ik has already ended it,
and you should…

00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:02.500
HONG HYE-JOO

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:05.045
Woo-seong!

00:25:07.547 --> 00:25:09.424
Since when?

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:11.426
Since when have you been
talking to Hye-joo?

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:14.971
Don't get it wrong.
I only did what you should've done.

00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:16.514
And what exactly is that?

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:18.850
What is it you did for me?

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:23.104
You know, this is a crucial time for you.

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:26.191
You just started your solo activities.
If you get tangled up

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:27.901
- with her again--
- So that's it?

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:30.654
{\an8}So you just cut off on your own?

00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:32.280
{\an8}Without even telling me?

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:35.867
- You know why better than anyone.
- It's none of your concern.

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:37.035
Ra-ik…

00:25:37.118 --> 00:25:38.745
Woo-seong, I'm…

00:25:38.828 --> 00:25:41.998
I'm not angry
because you didn't tell me about Hye-joo

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:45.168
or because you tried
to decide everything on your own.

00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:47.921
What really makes me angry…

00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:53.718
is that there are secrets between us now.

00:25:57.097 --> 00:25:59.724
{\an8}IT'LL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.270
To me, Hye-joo was something like…

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:07.065
a long-overdue assignment.

00:26:20.495 --> 00:26:21.830
Where are you going?

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:23.081
We're out of beer.

00:26:23.164 --> 00:26:24.374
I'll be right back.

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:35.885
I couldn't put it off forever.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.514
I really thought…

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.227
It was time to end it for good.

00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.562
HONG HYE-JOO

00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.736
{\an8}I'm at our usual spot.

00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.571
I'll wait until you come out.

00:27:00.076 --> 00:27:01.703
That is why I went to meet her.

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:12.213
You have five minutes.
Let's finish this in that time.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.799
Five minutes?

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:21.431
It's been years since we last met.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.768
And five minutes?

00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:30.648
I came here because this was the only way
you'd really understand.

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:34.527
{\an8}I don't want to keep in touch with you.

00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:37.280
All your calls and messages bother me.

00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.700
Don't reach out to me like this again.

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.285
I missed you.

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.457
I missed you.

00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:51.002
That's why I'm here.

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:54.714
I…

00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:55.924
I mean…

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.926
Back then…

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.720
I was too young.

00:28:02.972 --> 00:28:04.641
Even so,

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:09.104
I shouldn't have said something
that would hurt you.

00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:17.112
I'm sick of this.

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:21.199
What?

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.787
I've put everything into this solo album.

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:29.874
I'm not letting you mess up my life again.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.671
So please, just get lost.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.530
I'm sorry.

00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:28.910
What?

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:30.995
I didn't mean to hide it.

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:33.748
I just…

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:37.502
You were trying to protect her, right?

00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.842
That's why you acted so cold.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.344
You were afraid she might get hurt.

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.140
You wanted her far from the case.

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.866
To me, Hye-joo is…

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:24.382
Someone I wanted to protect, but couldn't.

00:31:27.468 --> 00:31:29.053
And we're completely over now.

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.390
That's why I couldn't tell you.

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:37.395
I was afraid that saying anything
would drag her into this.

00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:47.864
I don't want her involved
in this case anymore.

00:31:50.658 --> 00:31:53.161
Can you help me?

00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:05.131
No dashcam, no messages.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.634
You'll keep denying everything?

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:09.427
Because it's the truth.

00:32:10.053 --> 00:32:14.098
We met in private as friends, that's all.

00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:17.769
So a friend you hadn't seen in years,

00:32:17.852 --> 00:32:19.562
you tried to hit with a car?

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:29.280
Ms. Hong Hye-joo? I won't ask again.

00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:33.242
I already know you met Do Ra-ik
at the estimated time of the incident.

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:37.205
Why did the two of you meet that night?

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.165
I told you.

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.126
We just met as friends.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.127
Ms. Hong Hye-joo,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.756
if you keep refusing
to back up your alibi,

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:50.677
your status may change
from witness to suspect.

00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:53.888
And if you end up in court,

00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:56.474
these statements can work against you.

00:32:56.557 --> 00:32:57.892
By the way, Prosecutor…

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:02.480
do they know?

00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:04.357
About our blind date?

00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:12.115
Just answer my question.

00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:14.701
You should answer mine.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.288
Why did you do it that day?

00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:22.625
Telling me confidential details
of the investigation so easily

00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:24.627
and pushing Ra-ik
as the culprit with no proof.

00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:28.172
Isn't that some kind of illegal disclosure
of case details?

00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:31.509
Who are you trying to lecture
about the law?

00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:33.720
Ra-ik is not the killer.

00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:37.473
Before you rush
to label him as the culprit,

00:33:37.557 --> 00:33:40.768
check the alibis
of people around him first.

00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:50.570
I saw on the news that his group members
were at the hospital that night.

00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:52.488
That's not true.

00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:55.033
What?

00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:57.535
That night I saw him

00:33:59.495 --> 00:34:01.706
near Ra-ik's house.

00:34:02.623 --> 00:34:03.875
I saw Choi Jae-hee.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.754
Why should I keep it secret?

00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:12.592
You have to tell me a reason.

00:34:14.594 --> 00:34:16.429
I mean, now the director is…

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:27.023
What's with you?

00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:31.527
No, what's with you?

00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.159
What?

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.661
You know you've been acting weird lately?

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:44.540
You lied that Ra-ik and Woo-seong
never got along.

00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:47.418
- Why did you do that?
- Hey!

00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:50.379
Who are you calling a liar?

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.008
I'm not the one lying, that jerk is!

00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:56.803
- What?
- You don't know a damn thing.

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:58.805
That bastard…

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.604
Forget it.

00:35:08.314 --> 00:35:10.274
If you know nothing, stay out of it.

00:35:11.025 --> 00:35:13.486
And stop eavesdropping like a rat.

00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:44.475
If you're hungry, you can eat…

00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:50.356
What are you doing?

00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:51.607
What do you mean?

00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.943
I'm getting changed.

00:35:54.777 --> 00:35:57.280
I told you to knock before coming out.

00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.241
When did you say that?

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.910
And I'm in my house, in my room.

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:05.163
You could change in the bathroom.

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:08.332
That's such a hassle every time.

00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:11.085
But where are you going?

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:16.883
You asked me to help Hong Hye-joo.
I need to figure out how.

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.802
Really? You're really helping?

00:36:20.928 --> 00:36:22.638
- Then I'll help too.
- No thanks.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.603
This isn't something you can do.
This is my job as your lawyer.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.358
But don't expect too much.
I'm just going to look into it.

00:36:36.068 --> 00:36:37.195
Wait…

00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:41.908
It's not that I'm suspicious or anything,

00:36:42.742 --> 00:36:45.036
but you told me not to hide anything, so…

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:47.663
I'm just saying this because I should…

00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:50.708
Hye-joo told me earlier

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:53.753
that she saw Jae-hee
that night after I left.

00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:57.381
- She saw Choi Jae-hee?
- Yes.

00:36:57.465 --> 00:37:00.134
But Jae-hee
was at the hospital that night.

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.385
Seems like there's been a mistake.

00:37:03.262 --> 00:37:06.307
And I'm not telling you to suspect him.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.184
I just wanted to tell you.

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:14.732
I don't want to hide
anything from you anymore.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.655
Okay, I'll look into it.

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:09.495
Why is this house so empty?

00:38:40.693 --> 00:38:42.528
So she used to smile when she was little.

00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:20.983
Do Ra-ik is not the culprit.

00:39:21.984 --> 00:39:23.152
No way!

00:39:43.005 --> 00:39:44.507
Why isn't she answering?

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:50.221
Hey, why don't you pick up my calls?

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.556
What's with that face?

00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:55.059
Did you read the text I sent?

00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:57.812
- I got the taxi's dashcam, and Hye-joo--
- I know.

00:39:57.895 --> 00:40:00.356
She tried to run Do Ra-ik over with a car.

00:40:00.439 --> 00:40:01.524
How did you find out?

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.318
Since when do you drink?

00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.654
You didn't drink
so you wouldn't slip up with him.

00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:13.577
The day of the incident
Hong Hye-joo saw Choi Jae-hee.

00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:16.247
He testified that he was at the hospital.
But I don't think so.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.665
Check his alibi properly.

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:18.833
Okay.

00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:22.420
But shouldn't we deal with Hong Hye-joo
and Do Ra-ik first?

00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:25.131
Yeah, we need to.

00:40:25.965 --> 00:40:27.299
Right, we do.

00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:29.176
But how? There's no way.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.136
Yes, there is.

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.263
What way?

00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:33.431
Chung-jae.

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:36.517
Why does it hurt this much?

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.768
You're hurting?

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.312
I knew you were pushing yourself too hard.

00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:42.523
Hold on, I've got some medicine somewhere.

00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:49.071
Let me see, do you have a fever?

00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:50.156
My heart.

00:40:51.824 --> 00:40:53.534
My heart hurts.

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.789
What happened?

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:01.834
Chung-jae, I thought

00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:05.379
I knew everything about Ra-ik.

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:10.176
When he's happy, he scrunches his nose.

00:41:10.259 --> 00:41:12.720
When he's focused,
his mouth hangs open a little.

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:17.892
When he's nervous,
his ears twitch just a bit.

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:20.644
I knew all that, and yet…

00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:24.190
I never realized

00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:26.609
how much he was hurting.

00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:29.361
He must have been

00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:32.823
in so much pain.

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.992
What about your pain?

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.077
Is it nothing?

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:41.540
Do you remember?

00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:44.627
Back when your firm became
Goldie Entertainment's legal advisor,

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.088
I asked why you didn't take it,
and you said

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.759
you didn't want to get
too close to Do Ra-ik.

00:41:54.094 --> 00:41:57.723
That you just wanted to watch him
from a distance… on stage.

00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:03.145
I didn't understand
what you meant back then,

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:05.648
but after all this, I kind of get it now.

00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:11.529
The more you get to know,
the closer you get,

00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:13.948
the more layers you peel back,

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:17.201
the more disappointing
people usually turn out to be.

00:42:19.328 --> 00:42:20.746
I'm not disappointed.

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.375
It's just unfamiliar.

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.669
And that scares me.

00:42:29.922 --> 00:42:31.215
Back then,

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.760
whether I was sad or happy,

00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:37.555
it always felt like
Ra-ik was right beside me.

00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:38.681
But now…

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:46.188
even when he's right next to me,

00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:50.234
he feels so far away.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.739
Earlier…

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.410
when I saw the two of them…

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.333
they felt like people
from a different world.

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:09.628
A world…

00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:13.841
I could never reach.

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:21.557
I wish I were disappointed.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.269
I wish I were jealous.

00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:26.395
But…

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.735
I can't even feel that.

00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:51.146
If only I could…

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:55.234
I would go back.

00:44:58.237 --> 00:44:59.655
If only I could…

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:02.866
with everything in me.

00:45:04.618 --> 00:45:06.578
I'd go back to being distant again.

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:31.562
Somewhere far enough
that I'd never touch him.

00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:35.107
I want to see him smile again.

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:39.903
I want to like him freely.

00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:46.243
The way I used to.

00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:40.339
Attorney Maeng…

00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:44.551
Attorney Maeng?

00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:52.184
Where did she go this morning?

00:47:01.276 --> 00:47:04.488
Don't leave anything, eat it all.
I'll check when I get back.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.083
You are up.

00:47:17.584 --> 00:47:19.836
- Where's Attorney Maeng?
- She already left for work.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.257
Here, take this.

00:47:27.427 --> 00:47:28.637
What's this?

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.681
This is a mild, low-pH cleanser

00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:33.433
with six plant-based,
gentle cleansing ingredients.

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:36.603
Ra-ik has really sensitive skin,
so he can only use this brand.

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:39.356
Can't you see? It's for washing your face.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.609
And this. Ra-ik has some gum issues.

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:46.029
So it has to be an extra-soft brush
and gum-care toothpaste.

00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:47.698
- They're a set.
- Here.

00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:51.201
And this, a handmade German classic razor,

00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:53.579
the exact kind he normally uses.

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:58.625
And this is European Oeko-Tex certified
100% cotton towel.

00:47:58.709 --> 00:47:59.585
Take this too.

00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:02.337
And these are supplements.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.549
He looked way too thin yesterday.

00:48:05.632 --> 00:48:08.385
- Make sure he takes them.
- These are the vitamins.

00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.846
And this is omega-3,

00:48:10.929 --> 00:48:12.389
probiotics.

00:48:12.472 --> 00:48:15.058
Lutein with zeaxanthin and astaxanthin,
all in one.

00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:19.855
{\an8}And this one's
the Optimized Fucoidan capsules.

00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.941
- Did you get all that?
- I don't care!

00:48:24.192 --> 00:48:26.987
Just wash up and eat.
Attorney Maeng will contact you.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.530
These are all the things I use.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.617
What a coincidence.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.081
This is what I do. Background checks.

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:40.292
It's all on Y**Tube anyway.

00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:43.003
"What's In My Bag?", "Sweet My Home,"
all that stuff.

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:47.007
Her rule is to satisfy
every single need of her clients.

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:50.510
She really is a pro.

00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:57.142
She didn't come home until dawn yesterday.

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.102
Were you two together?

00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:00.979
Yeah, why?

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:02.606
Just asking.

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:05.651
But what are you two exactly?

00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:07.486
Different last names, are you related?

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:12.491
Let's just say connected
in a way more tangled than blood.

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:14.409
Why are you asking?

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:17.746
No reason, just being polite.

00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:20.040
Ever heard of small talk?

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.090
Why is that guy always so prickly
whenever he sees me?

00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:32.177
Is he a hater?

00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:39.434
Even after all that pain,
she's not mad at him?

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:43.438
Still taking care of everything.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.109
DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING
EAT IT ALL, I'LL CHECK.

00:50:55.635 --> 00:50:59.181
Yes, Director.
I just checked the email you sent.

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:02.809
Thank you so much for your help.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.228
Yes.

00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:21.912
Is the interrogation today?

00:51:21.995 --> 00:51:23.997
I had no idea. I didn't prepare anything.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.416
You don't have to.
Today, ambush is the strategy.

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:30.587
Let's go give them a proper blow.

00:51:35.634 --> 00:51:38.428
I didn't summon you, yet you just show up.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:44.226
It's not just about the questioning.
I think we can assist your investigation.

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.398
Quite the excuse.

00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:54.277
You think I don't see through
this obvious tactic

00:51:54.361 --> 00:51:56.780
trying to present an image of innocence
by voluntarily appearing?

00:51:56.863 --> 00:52:01.326
Dragging out the case without indicting,
stalling while tossing around hypotheses,

00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:03.245
that's a pretty obvious tactic too.

00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:09.417
This is the footage from that day,
showing Do Ra-ik and Hong Hye-joo.

00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:11.419
As you'll see,

00:52:11.503 --> 00:52:15.507
there is no sign whatsoever
of the two colluding to commit a crime.

00:52:16.716 --> 00:52:20.095
We already have this.

00:52:20.178 --> 00:52:24.349
Context changes entirely depending on
how you look at it.

00:52:24.432 --> 00:52:26.810
Since you saw it, you should know better.

00:52:26.893 --> 00:52:29.771
That our meeting
was completely personal and private.

00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:33.066
That's something
we'll need to look into further.

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.944
You could have met
to conceal evidence, couldn't you?

00:52:38.738 --> 00:52:41.867
But you already know, Prosecutor.

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.661
That scenario was impossible
given the circumstances.

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.584
These are the call records
of CEO Geum Bo-sang.

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:53.795
As you can see,
after Do Ra-ik returned home,

00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:56.256
{\an8}there's a call
between him and Kang Woo-seong.

00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:58.800
We've already secured
Mr. Geum's full statement as well.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.053
If, as you claim,

00:53:02.137 --> 00:53:05.098
Do Ra-ik and Hong Hye-joo met
to conceal evidence,

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:07.392
they would have had the murder weapon

00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:09.394
and Kang Woo-seong's phone with them.

00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:11.771
But after their meeting,

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.481
Kang Woo-seong called Mr. Geum,

00:53:13.565 --> 00:53:16.401
so that proves
he was still alive at the time.

00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:20.530
Therefore, your current claim
doesn't align with the timeline.

00:53:22.657 --> 00:53:24.618
An investigation must always

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:27.329
remain open to multiple possibilities.

00:53:27.412 --> 00:53:30.290
Just because the timeline
doesn't match the crime

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:32.375
doesn't automatically rule out collusion.

00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:36.087
The two of them could have met

00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:38.298
beforehand to plan
Kang Woo-seong's murder.

00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:45.764
Then can you provide
any objective evidence

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.850
that these two were planning the crime?

00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:50.477
We're conducting this investigation

00:53:51.102 --> 00:53:53.063
to obtain such evidence.

00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:56.107
Hong Hye-joo may be involved in the case--

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.442
"May be involved?"

00:53:58.276 --> 00:54:00.070
Based solely on that speculation,

00:54:00.695 --> 00:54:03.698
with no evidence or supporting facts,
you summoned her

00:54:03.782 --> 00:54:06.618
and interrogated her intensively
for over six hours?

00:54:06.701 --> 00:54:10.163
Well, if it's necessary
during the course of an investigation--

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.623
A legitimate investigation

00:54:11.706 --> 00:54:14.542
should be based
on concrete evidence of the alleged crime.

00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:17.963
You cannot proceed
without objective evidence.

00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:19.673
It's clearly a targeted investigation.

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:20.590
What?

00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:23.718
What you're admitting is that
after labeling him as your prime suspect,

00:54:23.802 --> 00:54:26.513
you pressured Ms. Hong Hye-joo
without a single piece of evidence,

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:29.891
simply to force the circumstances
to fit your narrative.

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:34.270
As his legal representative,
I'm issuing a formal demand.

00:54:34.354 --> 00:54:36.940
Cease your excessive investigation
into Ms. Hong immediately.

00:54:37.023 --> 00:54:40.318
Otherwise, we'll file a complaint
stating that the prosecution

00:54:40.402 --> 00:54:43.363
is conducting an unjust investigation
against our client.

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.032
Is that what you want?

00:54:57.419 --> 00:54:59.587
Is it all over now?

00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:02.632
Hye-joo…
They won't call her back again, right?

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:07.637
Since everything is properly settled,
they can't treat her as an accomplice.

00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:09.597
Not unless some new evidence appears.

00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:10.765
Really?

00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:15.103
Yes. They might conduct
a simple witness questioning, but…

00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:41.588
Thank you… All thanks to Maeng Se-na.

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:45.967
Thank you so much.

00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:49.679
No… I…

00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:52.057
Stinky!

00:56:01.399 --> 00:56:02.942
Would you step aside for a moment?

00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:04.986
Why should I?

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.866
Just wait in the car. I'll be right there.

00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:33.681
Long time no see.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.059
Class 1-4, Jeil Foreign Language High.

00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:37.185
Stinky Se-na.

00:56:38.937 --> 00:56:40.563
No, Maeng Se-na.

00:56:43.983 --> 00:56:45.777
Sorry, should have recognized you sooner.

00:56:46.694 --> 00:56:49.656
You've changed a lot since high school.

00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:53.576
Of course I have.

00:56:54.452 --> 00:56:58.832
I'm old enough now not to keep company
with people who barely qualify as human.

00:57:01.334 --> 00:57:02.794
We have a lot to talk about.

00:57:02.877 --> 00:57:07.006
Like how you've been,
why you took this case,

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.175
whether you knew I was the prosecutor

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:11.636
and took it on purpose,

00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:12.971
or if you planned it

00:57:13.721 --> 00:57:15.431
to screw me over from the start.

00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:20.228
No wonder this investigation
is going nowhere.

00:57:20.311 --> 00:57:24.023
You're too busy obsessing over
irrelevant crap like this.

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.024
What?

00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:27.402
How long are you going to live
with that victim complex?

00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:30.113
Use that time to work on your skills.

00:57:30.196 --> 00:57:34.159
Then you'll catch the real culprit
and be the star prosecutor you want to be.

00:57:38.496 --> 00:57:39.581
Good luck.

00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:10.904
You seem pretty close
with that prosecutor.

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.489
How do you two know each other?

00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:13.615
I don't.

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.914
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- No, you tell me.

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:25.001
What are you talking about?

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.889
It's too obvious.

00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:40.683
You act like you've never dated anyone.

00:58:40.767 --> 00:58:43.603
You've got one guy at home
and one at work.

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:45.647
What are you even talking about?

00:58:46.773 --> 00:58:49.400
I've thought about this for a while.

00:58:49.484 --> 00:58:51.361
The way that guy looks at you is weird.

00:58:52.278 --> 00:58:55.240
So what is he? An ex?

00:58:57.116 --> 00:58:58.368
Are you out of your mind?

00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:00.954
Me? With that bastard?

00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:06.584
He's just an unlucky classmate
I got stuck with.

00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:08.378
I'd scrub him out if I could!

00:59:08.962 --> 00:59:12.006
For a classmate,
you sound extremely hostile.

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.883
Whenever I think about that jerk,

00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:17.053
I jolt awake
in the middle of the night, fuming.

00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:21.724
Okay, I get it, so just drive carefully!

00:59:21.808 --> 00:59:23.184
You're a lawyer and yet…

00:59:23.268 --> 00:59:26.104
No, it's not me.

00:59:26.187 --> 00:59:29.816
- The car isn't listening to me.
- What?

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:34.737
Se-na!

00:59:36.155 --> 00:59:38.116
Se-na!

00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:40.159
- Se-na!
- No, Ra-ik!

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:38.801
{\an8}I've never been loved.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.219
{\an8}What are you doing?

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.180
{\an8}I don't know how to give love

01:00:42.263 --> 01:00:43.598
{\an8}or receive it.

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:45.266
{\an8}Are you saying someone did it?

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:46.267
{\an8}Doesn't feel right.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:49.937
{\an8}If someone really held
a grudge against me…

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:51.522
{\an8}Why did you lie?

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.274
{\an8}It's…

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.692
{\an8}I don't really know.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.987
{\an8}If needed, you should consider

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.572
{\an8}shaping the flow yourself.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:03.034
{\an8}So you're telling me to drop my client?

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:08.581
