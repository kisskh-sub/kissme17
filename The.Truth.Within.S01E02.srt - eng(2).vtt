WEBVTT

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.940
Aren't you a forensic?

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.810
What brings you to our squad?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.330
What's your connections to
the Raw Diamond case?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.580
None.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.810
Then why'd you show up
at the trading spot?

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.900
Answer me!

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.300
Why did you come here?

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.060
Not just me.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.890
Anyone here,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.700
and even anyone Lanzi might

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.860
have met after she left,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.700
could be the killer.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.820
We're gonna check

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.050
every suspect.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.890
But right now, you're our prime suspect.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.940
In the autopsy report,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.380
was there any

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.050
erosive bleeding?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.730
Or any foreign objects
in Lanzi's stomach?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.860
Please go ahead.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.730
You've got a person
dead from cyanide poisoning,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.170
but you can't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.660
figure out when or where

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.170
the poison got slipped to her?

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.100
It means

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.050
the poison was already in her body.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.330
You mean there's no killer?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.700
Qiu Lanzi poisoned and killed herself?

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.610
You found my fingerprints

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.980
on that bottle of water.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.940
But it's because

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.290
that one wasn't for Lanzi.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.820
Ms. Zhu!

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.210
Ms. Zhu,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.170
what did Mr. Qi say?

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.100
He thinks the cyanide

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.010
was already in Qiu Lanzi's body.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.580
How did he know?

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.700
The report was turned in just now.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.050
Have you heard of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.050
remote case-solving?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.940
It's to find out the truth

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.330
by analyzing crime scenes

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.980
and examining bodies
without physical presence.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.860
Only a few forensic doctors can do this,

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.700
and Qi Sizhe is one of them.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.330
Gao Yuan.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.980
Check the stuff he used in the lab.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.290
Then compare them
with that bottle of water.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.210
Okay.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.100
I go with you.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.500
Did you transfer here

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.060
because of what happened before?

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.060
You followed Jiang Fei,

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.970
went to the bar,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.330
and visited Li Yiqi in the hospital.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.970
What do you wanna do?

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.870
I've told you.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.770
That's not truth.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.010
Han Feng.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.060
You really think

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.580
I'd kill a forensic intern

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.380
I just met?

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.300
You know very well

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.770
it couldn't be me.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.140
What I think matters not.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.090
Figuring out the truth matters.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.770
Since he's helping with the case,

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.820
maybe you could clue him in

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.580
on some of the stuff we've dug up,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.620
just enough to

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.010
speed things along

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.770
and catch the killer faster.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.450
Okay.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.970
Mr. Gao.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.410
Please test Mr. Qi's water

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.890
and effervescent tablets.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.820
Tell us what you find out.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.450
Okay.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.260
Thank you.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.330
Mr. Han. Ms. Zhu.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.380
The results come out.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.530
The report shows

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.620
each of their saliva

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.180
in the other's water.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.410
So Qiu Lanzi took his water by mistake.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.380
Yes.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.940
The water Lanzi drank

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.450
should be Mr. Qi's soda water.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.740
And in Mr. Qi's bag

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.970
was just mineral water.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.500
Okay.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.380
Gotta go.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.210
Mr. Han. Ms. Zhu.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.820
I've sure you've known why

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.820
my fingerprints were on
that bottle of water.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.330
I wanna know why you said

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.140
the cyanide was already

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.060
in Qiu Lanzi's body.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.090
I think Lanzi was usually on meds.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.530
We did find some
stomach meds in her bag.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.300
What meds?

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.180
Omeprazole.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.500
What else did the autopsy find?

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.770
Found two drug capsules in her stomach.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.970
The shells looked melted,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.450
and one of them had cracked open.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.890
Last question.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.410
How many pills are left
in her medicine bottle?

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.650
Just one.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.820
I think I know

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.010
how Lanzi was murdered.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.260
Lanzi's stomach med,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.580
omeprazole, is an
enteric-coated capsule.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.650
It's designed to pass through

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.940
the stomach without
breaking down in the acid,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.500
then get absorbed

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.970
in the intestines
where things are more alkaline.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.140
However,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.820
it was found in her stomach.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.380
Why?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.700
Qiu Lanzi took your water by mistake.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.410
It was soda water,

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.850
making the capsule dissolve quicker.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.310
The coating on the capsules
is slow-release,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.940
so they should start working within

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.660
4 to 12 hours.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.180
But she drank soda,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.450
and that cut the time

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.060
way short.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.530
So the cyanide

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.210
was hidden in Lanzi's

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.770
stomach med capsules.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.740
One of the two capsules in her stomach

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.500
had cracked open.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.300
The killer must've noticed it too

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.510
when slipping cyanide

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.770
into the capsules.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.130
Once the capsule coating

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.250
gets partly dissolved by the soda,

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.450
the cyanide inside

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.090
comes into contact with
the stomach lining.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.700
The corrosive poison will definitely

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.580
cause erosive bleeding in there.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:45.730
How to prove it?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.780
There's still one pill left
in her medicine bottle.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.090
Su.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.780
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhao.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.730
The cooperation with
He City is about to end,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.780
and you're going abroad.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.180
Sorry we have to call you back.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.130
It's fine.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.210
I'll be there if you need me.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.700
So what happened?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.700
What do you want me to check?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.940
Mr. Qi figured

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.020
the victim might take

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.780
omeprazole capsules laced with cyanide,

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.300
but then drank soda by accident.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.020
That made

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.300
the capsule dissolve in the stomach

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.300
instead of the intestines.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.540
We've found

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.940
the capsules in her stomach.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.730
So we need you here

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.970
to test one last pill

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.780
in the victim's

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.210
medicine bottle.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:38.970
I got this.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:39.940
Thank you.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.610
How is it?

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.580
Ms. Zhao is testing the pill.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.130
It needs some time.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.420
Cross-check all the evidence

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.510
and don't miss any details.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.700
I'll wait here.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.330
Okay.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.730
The dosage of omeprazole is

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.020
three pills a day,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.850
one in the morning
and two in the evening.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.940
If the killer wanted to

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.660
make sure Lanzi died

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.180
that very night,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.940
he must've made certain

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.090
at least

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.700
one of the two pills

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.370
she took was poisoned.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.610
If he only poisoned one pill,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.730
Lanzi might not take it

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.420
until the second morning.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.780
That's a one-in-three chance.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.970
But if he poisoned three pills,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.250
then there'd always be

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.940
one poisoned pill left

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.970
as evidence.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.730
So,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.970
poisoning exactly

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.820
two pills

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.370
was the sweet spot.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.610
But if Qiu Lanzi

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.420
took both the poisoned ones,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.210
we couldn't find anything

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.090
in the left one as evidence.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.250
She's got a one-in-three chance of

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.540
swallowing both poisoned pills,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.020
which means

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.130
the killer only has that same shot at

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.090
not leaving evidence in the medicine.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.420
So we're just gambling on the last one.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.450
We've got the result.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.540
The pill indeed contains cyanide,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.540
same as Mr. Qi supposed.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.250
Mr. Qi, you're off the hook for now.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.250
You can go.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:09.850
Ms. Zhu.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.250
I wanna help with the case

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.900
and find out Lanzi's murderer.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:14.940
And,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.130
something's off with Jiang Fei's

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.330
autopsy report.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.020
I'm afraid you gotta stay outta

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.610
Jiang Fei and Qiu Lanzi's case.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.420
I wanna see Jiang Fei's autopsy report.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.090
You're not the only forensic here.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.700
You don't gotta handle
every single case.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:12:59.970
Come in.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.660
Mr. Bai.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.900
Qi Sizhe is off the hook now?

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:11.730
Yes.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.060
And he found out how Qiu Lanzi died?

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.420
Qi Sizhe is a brilliant forensic doctor.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.420
And he's quite reasonable.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.540
So he won't

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.300
blame you for the necessity of

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.210
your interrogation of him.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.660
Mr. Bai.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.450
Do you know about his past?

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.940
He had a severe car accident.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.730
And I thought we'd lose

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.020
a talented forensic doctor.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940
But I never thought

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.610
he'd manage to hit rehab milestones

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.250
in just a year that usually

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.060
take others three to five years.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.730
You can imagine

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.940
how much this position means to him.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.300
But he's quite stubborn.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.130
So is Han Feng.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.090
Among you three,

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.330
you're the calmest
and most rational one.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.330
So I hope you can

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.540
get them together

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.970
and handle cases.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.370
Where's Xi?

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.330
I had her check 788 Bar's
security footage.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.660
I still have some doubts.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.420
We found the cyanide

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.780
in Qiu Lanzi's stomach meds.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.820
The killer could

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.370
get close to her

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.820
and switch her meds.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.450
So it could be someone

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.420
she knew all along.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.020
Qiu Lanzi said something was off

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.490
with Jiang Fei's body.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.970
Ask Mr. Gao to

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.130
check his autopsy report again.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.660
Su.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.300
Dig deeper into

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.940
the social circles around

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.060
Qiu Lanzi, Jiang Fei, and Li Yiqi,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.210
especially Qiu Lanzi's connections.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:57.850
Okay.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.020
Mr. Han.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.780
Anything to add?

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.580
Nothing, for now.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.850
Xi, got anything?

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.210
Yeah.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.730
Half a month before Li Yiqi's case,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:07.970
Mr. Qi showed up

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.780
at 788 Bar quite a few times.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.820
I cross-checked a few security footages.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.130
Every time Mr. Qi showed up,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.850
Jiang Fei was there too.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:15.900
Looks like

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.970
Mr. Qi was following Jiang Fei.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:32.940
Ms. Zhu.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.900
Here's Qi Sizhe's info.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.060
He had a severe

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.940
accident two years ago.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.420
A woman riding in his car

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.180
died on the spot.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.390
Ms. Zhu.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.580
Anything wrong with him?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.370
Get back to work.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:50.940
Yes.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.090
Why did you come?

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.500
Why did you follow
Li Yiqi and Jiang Fei?

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.530
You know why.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.020
'Cause it's related to Fei's death.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.260
Raw Diamond...

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.850
You came for the Raw Diamond case.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.060
Jiang Fei's death isn't an accident.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.980
It's a murder.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.930
His body was found

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.410
at 11:30 or so

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.130
in the morning.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.330
It's the same as room temperature,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.540
22 degrees.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.650
He's got these

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.410
little square marks on his chest,

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.650
bright red.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.300
And the lividity on the side of
the body is all patchy,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.220
dark red.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.300
Any problems?

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.460
The bright red lividity

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.930
doesn't match the estimated time

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:29.500
of death,

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.370
and the body's cooling rate is way off.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.850
There are two possibilities.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.820
First,

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.740
the killer was trying to mess with

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.580
the time of death.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:37.690
Second,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.610
the way the murder was done

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.460
messed with the body's temperature.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:42.890
And I think

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.540
the second one's way more likely.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.580
So my guess is,

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.820
Jiang Fei probably...

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.060
Froze to death?

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.980
At his own home?

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:53.460
But his place

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.610
doesn't have such an environment.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.740
There is one.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.850
No way.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.130
It's too small.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.780
If the killer stuffed Jiang Fei

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.930
into the fridge,

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.130
there gotta be

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.090
a lot of scratches and marks

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.980
on Jiang Fei's body.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.260
But so far,

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.610
there aren't any

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.500
such marks on the body.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.890
Only lividity.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.890
Lividity is the marks formed by blood

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.890
due to gravity at the dripping points.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.980
Jiang Fei was lying on his side

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.780
when he died.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:35.780
So,

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.300
the lividity should only
have formed on the side.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:39.740
But look here.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:42.850
There are bright red marks

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.130
on Jiang Fei's chest.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.850
Also, when Jiang Fei died,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.410
his clothes were all wrinkled.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.460
His clothes look like they got wet

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:53.890
and then dried off...

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.220
His fingers and toes were

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:57.980
all wrinkled,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.330
a result of

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.580
prolonged soaking in water

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.850
and osmosis.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.540
Jiang Fei was

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.930
always a slob,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.300
so it's no wonder
his clothes were wrinkled.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.930
When we found the body,

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.740
there was water
at the bottom of the bathtub.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.220
The wrinkles on his skin were

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.220
probably caused by soaking in the water.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.610
Well, going by your logic,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.690
his fingers and toes shouldn't

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.740
have gotten wrinkly

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.650
since they haven't touched

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.260
the water at the bottom of the tub.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.170
But turns out that's not what happened.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:32.580
So Jiang Fei didn't

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.930
freeze to death in a freezer,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:35.820
but in the...

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.020
In the bathtub.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.460
The window in

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.610
Jiang Fei's bathroom

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.300
has always been open.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.090
When the body was found,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.980
the ice had already melted,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.170
but there were frostbite

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.260
marks on the body.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.540
The bright red mark

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.780
on his chest is

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.650
the best proof.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:23.820
This is also caused by

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.330
the failure of

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.980
various organs at low temperatures.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.260
Judging from the traces at the scene,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.890
everything matches

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.130
what Mr. Qi said.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:36.820
Got it.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:40.980
Han Feng.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.930
Are you buying

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.690
that Jiang Fei's
death wasn't an accident

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.890
but murder now?

00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.850
If Mr. Qi's reasoning

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:00.610
holds up,

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.460
we gotta check this place

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.820
for any signs of

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.260
a second person.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.260
Search more thoroughly.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.260
I wanna learn more from you

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.020
and become a great
forensic doctor like you!

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:27.500
Ms. Zhu.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.820
Any progress

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.980
in Jiang Fei's case?

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.060
You've been cleared of suspicion.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.540
So why still look into Jiang Fei?

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.930
I know you're really
concerned about Jiang Fei's case

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.500
and Li Yiqi's case.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.540
I also know

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.540
you can lead us closer to the truth.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.460
But so far,

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.060
you haven't explained

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:51.690
the coincidences of your appearance

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.930
in these two cases.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:55.890
And this time,

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.220
why did you go to
investigate Jiang Fei alone?

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.500
I want you to answer my question.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.260
And I'm not gonna answer any questions

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.890
related to this case

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.330
until I trust you.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.540
Ms. Zhu.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.220
I'm a forensic doctor.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.410
When someone dies,

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.300
only forensic doctors can tell what they

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.260
went through before they died.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.690
And I believe

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.130
whoever it is,

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.820
even drug dealers like Jiang Fei,

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.890
they all deserve the truth.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.890
I saw the possibility

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.020
of homicide in Jiang Fei's case.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.330
So I gotta figure out the truth.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.820
But he's quite stubborn.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.690
So is Han Feng.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.460
So I hope you can

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.130
get them together

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.580
and handle cases.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.090
So Jiang Fei died

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.640
a little after 4 am?

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:03.930
Yes.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.170
If he froze to death,

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.300
his body temperature

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.500
was lower than normal.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:09.820
So the time it takes to cool down

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.540
would be shorter.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.170
Mr. Han.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.980
Mr. Qi inferred

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.240
that Jiang Fei froze to death.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.130
Let him tell us about it.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.460
All we know is

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.690
that Jiang Fei

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.780
was frozen to death by the killer,

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.170
but there aren't any clues

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.060
to find the killer.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.130
The killer made Jiang Fei

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.370
take cephalosporin

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.060
when he was drunk,

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.820
causing a disulfiram-like reaction.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.850
Then, when he was unconscious,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.930
the killer froze his body with ice,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.220
which led to the failure of all his

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.500
internal organs,
especially his heart, and he died.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.740
It shows that the killer
has some knowledge

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.740
human physiology.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:26:59.980
Mr. Gao,

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.300
after the first autopsy and test,

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.610
what was in his stomach

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.610
as food residue?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.890
Wine and sausage,

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.820
no cephalosporin.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.740
But the cephalosporin on his table

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.650
was already opened,

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.410
and the pharmacological
test detected it.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.370
The sausage wasn't digested,

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.650
which means the last thing

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:19.980
the victim ate was

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.650
the sausage.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.330
Have you found a knife there?

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.220
No.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.220
There are cuts on the sausage

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.410
but no knife around.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.410
Could someone have taken it?

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:41.690
Jiang Fei's body didn't have

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.610
a scratch on it.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.410
The knife couldn't be the murder weapon.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.930
So why'd the killer take it away?

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.330
Did you guys do luminol

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.020
at the scene?

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.650
There are no cuts on the body,

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.610
but the killer had to take the knife

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.690
from the scene.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:04.850
That means...

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.090
The knife wasn't used on the victim.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.060
But on the killer.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.890
If this isn't Jiang Fei's blood,

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.930
then it gotta be the killer's.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.130
Why didn't you ask Mr. Qi to

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.220
do the bloodstain comparison?

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.330
The results are out.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.220
No records matching in the database.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:08.130
Thank you.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.020
So here's the timeline of these cases.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.500
On the evening of the 7th,

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.500
Qiu Lanzi joined us investigating

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.130
the 788 Bar assault case.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.930
Then she teamed up
with Mr. Gao and Mr. Qi

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:32.890
for the Li Yiqi's

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.130
blood sample analysis

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.130
until the next day.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:36.930
We found

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.980
Jiang Fei's body at noon the next day,

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.780
and Qiu Lanzi showed up later.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.980
That night, she, Mr. Qi and Mr. Gao

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.930
dissected Jiang Fei's body.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.260
We found the remains of stomach meds

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.780
in Qiu Lanzi's stomach.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.930
Based on the dissolution
rate of the meds

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.500
and the timeline,

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.930
Qiu Lanzi should've
taken the stomach meds

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.130
between the time

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.130
after the dissection of Jiang Fei's body

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.220
and her death.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.370
The first time
Qiu Lanzi left the station

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.410
and met me

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.820
was around 9 pm.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.170
Two hours later,

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.850
I got a call from Qiu Lanzi.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.020
She said she'd

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.910
found a lead on Jiang Fei's body.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.580
Ten minutes later,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.690
when Mr. Han and I
got to the forensic office,

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.120
we found her body.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.130
The stomach medicine was found among

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:20.650
her belongings.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:21.780
She usually kept her stuff

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.740
in the locker in the changing room.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.890
Got anything from
the surveillance over there?

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.780
No cameras on the floor.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.820
There are just people
going to and from work there.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.220
And Mr. Bai means we shouldn't

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.890
expand the investigation for now.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.060
He wants us to narrow down
the suspects first.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.930
So the most likely time

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.580
for Qiu Lanzi to take the pills is

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.060
between the time

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.140
she left the station and came back.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:51.740
We just don't know

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.020
where she went and who she met.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.260
What about Jiang Fei?

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:04.890
Don't forget

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.580
Qiu Lanzi said she had info about

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.220
Jiang Fei's cause of death
before she died.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.500
Jiang Fei went home after getting drunk.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.890
Where did he drink

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:14.930
and who did he drink with?

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.690
Have you found out?

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.460
He didn't use mobile payment or cards.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.500
He always used cash,

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.930
so it's hard to find
his consumption records.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.130
People like him are always

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.090
afraid of leaving any clues.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.260
Wan,

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.410
let's go to the bar to check

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.420
Jiang Fei's movements before he drank.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.540
Xi,

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.930
go and find out

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.610
who Qiu Lanzi met

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.780
after she left the station.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:38.610
Let's split up.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:39.780
Okay.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.130
Do as Mr. Han says.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.930
It's here, Mr. Han.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.850
No, Mr. Han...

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.740
You're in charge here?

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:45.740
This is legit business.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.130
Legit business?

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.410
Then why so serious,

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:49.740
needing a guide to find here?

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.130
Oh, come on!

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.220
This is a gimmick.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.060
More people will wanna come in

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.090
if they need someone to bring them in.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:57.980
That's smart.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.060
Since it's so complicated to get here,

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.930
you should know who came here

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.090
the day before yesterday, right?

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.170
Sir.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.980
How the heck can I remember

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.410
all these guests every day?

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.580
Take us to the security room.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.020
Sir.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.890
You need a warrant to do so.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.410
A warrant, huh?

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.220
I'm gonna call my buddies

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.650
from Public Security Brigade

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.220
and let them check it out.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.540
Sir.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.650
You can check whatever you want.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.580
We checked Jiang Fei's social circles.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.580
Super complicated.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.460
He's lived in cities
all over the country.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.890
A drug dealer like him's gonna

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.090
have a lot of enemies.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.540
If we just look at
the motives for murder,

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.740
there are a bunch of suspects.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:43.980
Here's

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.330
his hidden ledger we found.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.580
There are up to
40 drug addicts listed in it,

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.170
not to mention those

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.930
who bought imitation guns,
plasma, and illegal drugs.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.460
Ms. Zhu.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.190
This is Qiu Lanzi's phone.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.370
Got anything?

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.740
I checked Qiu Lanzi's call records.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.930
After she left at 9 o'clock,

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.060
she made four consecutive calls
within five minutes,

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.780
and they were all to the same person.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.130
Who?

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.460
It's a chemical factory's lab.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.090
But it was off-work time then,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.340
and she called the switchboard,

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.540
so we still can't find out
who she contacted.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.580
We gotta find out what relationship

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.860
this factory has with Qiu Lanzi.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.500
Okay.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.290
Ms. Zhu.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.730
Have you checked Qiu Lanzi's phone?

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.810
Xi just gave it to me.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.090
I watched the videos

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.900
of Qiu Lanzi before
and after she left here.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.420
She never stopped checking her phone.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.500
I remembered that Mr. Han told me

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.210
when he saw Qiu Lanzi that day,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.980
she was also anxiously
checking her phone.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.390
There must be some clues on her phone.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.210
She just didn't

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.570
have time to tell us then.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.500
Stop.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.980
Who's the girl drinking

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:55.500
with Jiang Fei?

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.690
Jiang Fei had introduced her to us.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.420
Zhang Lu, I remember.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.690
She's into Lolita fashion,

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.130
close to Jiang Fei.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.500
She took photos of Jiang Fei's body?

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.650
But phones are forbidden
in the dissection room...

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.940
Maybe she had some reason.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.420
Check out these last three photos.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.810
The first two

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.340
are of the tattoo on Jiang Fei's arm,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.380
one taken without a black light,

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.020
and the other with a black light.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.580
And the last one

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.580
is of the skin on his wrist.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.860
Also, the first two
were taken at the same time.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.610
But there's a gap of
over 20 minutes before the last one.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.420
Why did she wait over 20 minutes to

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.130
take a photo of the skin on the wrist

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.980
without a black light?

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.420
What did she find out?

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.060
I saw some illegal stuff

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.170
in the bar near Ruixi Building.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.340
I just saw it when working.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.130
It's fine. You're welcome.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:55.980
Treat me to dinner then.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.130
Wan.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.770
Thank you.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.650
It's nothing.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.940
Ms. Zhu asked me

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.340
to investigate with you.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.710
No need to say that.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.580
I saw Qiu Lanzi taking

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.340
those photos,

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.980
but I just glanced and left.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.420
I was in the next room with Ms. Zhao

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.610
taking samples

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.290
for toxicology testing.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.650
If you also left,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.020
then Lanzi was the only one
left in the autopsy room.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.130
But when she was taking the photos,

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.860
she asked me what this was.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.900
What is this?

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.900
It should be an old injury

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.860
or a mark left after
having a tattoo removed.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.540
No.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.650
It seems to be a fluorescent tattoo.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.020
There are two photos of
the tattoo on the left forearm,

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.170
one in natural color

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.250
and the other under a black light.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.130
If we follow the logic of
the previous two photos,

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.980
there should be

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.060
another black-light photo.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.170
There are lots of group photos

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.940
of Jiang Fei with
different girls on his phone,

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.060
and one of them is

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.900
Zhang Lu, the girl
we've been looking for.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.900
Zhang Lu, 24 years old,

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.690
living in Xinhua Road, He City,

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.860
an intern researcher at
an inorganic chemistry institute,

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.060
majored in chemistry.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.860
She knows Qiu Lanzi.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.130
They were high school classmates,

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:42.810
so they rented an room

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.980
and were roommates shortly.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.650
In the call records we retrieved,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.610
the last call Qiu Lanzi made

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.380
was to Zhang Lu's workplace.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.380
You said you saw Zhang Lu

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.210
and Qiu Lanzi arguing that day, right?

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:08.980
Yeah.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.750
I did see them arguing.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.250
But I didn't catch what

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:17.580
they were arguing about.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.420
When I left,

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.420
I saw that girl wasn't feeling well

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.510
and took some medicine.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.210
Are you sure Qiu Lanzi
took medicine at that time?

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.250
I'm sure.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.730
Where's Zhang Lu?

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:45.170
Mr. Han.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.980
We've been searching for her

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.020
with your info.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:57.900
Excuse me.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.980
Your ID card and driving license please.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.170
Please open your trunk.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:09.500
You're Zhang Lu, right?

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:12.210
Zhang Lu.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.130
Please cooperate with us.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.290
Zhang Lu, 24 years old.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.020
A researcher of the chemistry institute

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.810
in He City.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.500
Were you at the basement bar

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.810
in Yunjin Building with Jiang Fei

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:39.810
on the evening of

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:40.940
August 7th?

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:42.900
Yeah.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.770
Then did you go home with him?

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:46.940
No.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.420
I just had a few drinks

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.500
and went back to my own place.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:50.730
Is there anyone who can prove it?

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:53.860
Prove it? Why?

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.420
I live alone.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:56.690
How can there be a witness?

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.020
So no one can prove

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.340
you stayed at

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.690
your own place that night.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:07.290
What was Jiang Fei's state when you

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.420
saw him for the last time?

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.690
He...

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.860
He seemed to catch cold.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.690
You're out

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.860
drinking with a cold?

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.650
Do you even know that
mixing antibiotics with alcohol

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.730
could kill you?

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.340
But I just really wanted to

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:31.650
have a drink with you.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:38.940
How'd you hurt your finger?

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.340
Cut it during

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:42.880
an experiment.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.380
What did Qiu Lanzi say

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.290
when she came to the lab?

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.340
What'd she tell you guys?

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.290
Isn't she interning here?

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.540
Call her over!

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:52.580
I'll confront her!

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:53.690
Qiu Lanzi's dead.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:56.940
Did you kill her?

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.900
Dead...

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.730
How... How come...

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.580
Zhang Lu,

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.770
now we suspect

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.580
you're the prime suspect
in the murder cases

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.420
of Qiu Lanzi and Jiang Fei.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.860
Got anything to say?

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:17.810
If Zhang Lu's blood sample

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:18.980
matches the one we took

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.170
from Jiang Fei's place,

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.130
she's most likely

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.910
the killer.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.210
I didn't!

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.540
I never killed anyone!

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.060
I didn't... I really didn't!

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:29.940
Then just answer

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.690
our questions!

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.340
What did she say to you?

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.210
She...

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.170
She told me

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.250
Jiang Fei was dead,

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.020
and she saw my name

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.690
on the body...

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:56.690
How is it?

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.060
Wait a moment.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:14.250
Ms. Zhu.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.940
The result is out.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.090
Mr. Han.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.130
It matches.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:27.900
Su.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:28.690
Arrest her.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:31.650
Xi, untie her.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.500
It's her.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.500
No...

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.170
Not me!

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.380
I didn't kill them!

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.690
I didn't!

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.540
It's not me!

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.610
It's really not me!

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.340
I never killed anyone!

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.340
It's not me!

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.210
I didn't!

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.860
Don't arrest me!

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.380
Please!

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:45.980
It's not me!

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.690
You got

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.380
the wrong person!

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.290
It's not me!

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:49.420
Not me!

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.060
Really not!

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.060
I didn't kill them!

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:51.980
You got the wrong person!

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.250
It's not me!

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.540
Not me!

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:03.610
We got the wrong person.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.650
It's not her.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.900
Raw Diamond case is over!

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.690
You just can't deal with reality!

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.810
You never figured out Fei's death!

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:37.130
Li Yiqi. Jiang Fei.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.830
They're the clue from the case!

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.340
Hey! Stop!

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:43.090
There's an opening here.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:44.210
The kidnapped girl was

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:45.340
probably taken inside.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.580
The killer set this up

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.610
to throw us off

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.540
about the cause of death.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.130
He knows way too much about

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:53.900
forensic,

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.690
autopsies, even our

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:56.690
police procedures.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:57.980
Wait, are you saying...

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.290
The killer is one of us?
