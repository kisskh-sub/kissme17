00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.420
=Light of Dawn=

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.150
Here's my plan.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.200
I'll get the information out Gao Feng.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.150
Mr. Ming, you back me up.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.090
Then we track down
whoever's stirring things up.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.910
What really matters is we need to use
our network around the group carefully.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.470
Talk to Mr. Cao to have him
get the negotiation plan ready

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.680
and prepare backups.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.280
At least three options.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.570
- I want everything by tonight...
- Stop bossing around.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.800
I'm not.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.960
This isn't child's play.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.190
I'm not playing around.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.000
From today on,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.960
you stay at home.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.710
Don't go anywhere.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.290
Mr. Ming will watch over you.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.800
Why?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.940
Didn't you say you wanted me to grow up

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.310
and take on more responsibility?

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.710
I've arranged everything.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.180
So why did you come back
and mess it all up?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.800
I'm not messing anything up.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.680
I'm helping you.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.710
I don't need it!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.970
Do you have any idea
how many employees we have?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.750
Do you know how many people
I feed in Binchuan?

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.750
If I want to find someone,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.790
I can turn all of Binchuan upside down
three times.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.360
I don't need you running around.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.800
And we're not afraid of inspections.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.150
No need for shady tricks.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.750
No need to make a big scene,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.710
looking for people

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.630
here and there.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.080
You're practically

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.360
handing them leverage.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.280
Starting today,
since you don't want to leave,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.080
stay home and behave.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.710
Feifei,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.630
parents only do what they do
for their children's sake.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.680
Don't go against your dad.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.000
Dad, it's time to
get your tubes changed.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.400
I'll do it for you.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.960
Didn't you say it was a hassle?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.040
Feifei.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.040
I spoke too harshly

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.870
earlier today.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.510
I know

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.070
you want to leave me

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.190
a clean and spotless company.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.800
When Mr. Xu and I first started out,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.270
the first money we made
wasn't exactly clean.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.830
There were shady dealings.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.870
One misstep,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.720
and we'd be doomed.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.190
We were rough,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.390
but we were simpler as well.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.830
Much simpler than people these days.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.800
I still don't know

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.190
what got into Gao Feng's mother

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.870
to make such a fuss.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.480
Dad, let me help you.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.390
I'll report everything to you. Please.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.720
Do you know

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.560
what Gao Feng said that convinced me?

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680
He said

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.000
he hoped I could figure out
who I really am.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.270
But Dad,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.040
if I leave you,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.830
I honestly don't know who I am anymore.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.390
(Gao Feng often asks me,)

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.990
("Have you ever thought about
why you were born?")

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.360
(I've thought about it seriously.)

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400
(I don't have an answer.)

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.720
(I barely remember my childhood.)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.190
(Gao Feng said he envies me.)

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.190
(Only happy childhood gets forgotten.)

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.360
(Maybe that's why I was born.)

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.390
(To protect the home
that gave me that happiness.)

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.950
What's that brat's trump card?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160
Test him.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.950
Find out who the woman behind this is.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.070
He has to be holding something.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.600
Perhaps my dream

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.950
lines up with my mother's clues.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.310
Dreams.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.160
He said he often dreams about
his mother.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.270
She's singing.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.070
And there's a house.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.430
Dreams?

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.950
When those women from the club
caused trouble,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.480
a house...

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.360
They secretly rented a place outside.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.160
Gao Feng.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.910
No way.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.560
Gao Feng!

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.800
Gao Feng!

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.800
Wake up!

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:00.830
Spit it out!

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.680
What are you doing?

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.270
What are you doing?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.870
I was just about to get there.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.240
Why poke your nose in?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.600
There?

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.840
Something about the dreams feels off.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.750
That's why I can't find it.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.420
=Episode 8=
=Follow a Dream=

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.720
Where did you get the meds?

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.960
Do you have any alcohol here?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.670
Something to help me sleep.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.390
There's too much on your mind.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.120
Alcohol won't help.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.200
My mother

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.670
died inside that statue
over twenty years ago.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.120
The truth about my birth must be ugly.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.550
Are you afraid?

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.670
I'm scared

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.200
that she died

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.840
because of me.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.320
Do you know
what my childhood dreams were like?

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.240
Mom, Dad, and I are
going to an amusement park.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.270
We're so happy.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.120
Roller coasters. Pirate ships.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.320
We ride everything.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.910
The three of us are happy together.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.630
But when I wake up,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.480
there's only disappointment.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.120
Because I know
I can never go back to that life.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.120
So maybe being afraid isn't a bad thing.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.270
At least it means your childhood

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.630
hasn't been sealed yet.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.720
Whether it was good or bad,
there's still hope.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.300
(Early 1990s, International Club)

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.900
(International Club)

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.200
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.630
Xiaohong,

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.150
I've always wanted to know

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.030
what's inside the room
we're never allowed near.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.320
We'll play it by ear tonight.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.910
Mr. Li is here. He wants you with him.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.720
I can't find the key.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.270
I'll check upstairs again.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.290
Go take care of him first.
I'll look for it later.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.630
(Dingweijia Food Stall)
When I went in,

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.670
I saw an entire wall of videotapes.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.240
I know they're watching us,

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.910
but I don't understand
why they record everything.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.440
They film those men.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.960
When they need them,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.390
the club uses those tapes as leverage.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.320
What should we do now?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.960
If they've recorded it,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.670
those tapes

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.870
can become our leverage too.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:50.910
Cheers.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.390
We must gather more evidence,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.090
so the police can launch
an investigation.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.630
With just the two of us,

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.150
trying to bring down the club

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.480
would be suicide.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.720
It's impossible.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.200
The stars we see

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.360
may already be gone.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.030
The light we see now

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.870
could be from a thousand years ago.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.600
Fireflies

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.600
or stars,

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.670
as long as they cross the sky,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.240
they leave their mark.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.390
You're my light.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.260
(A few weeks later)

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.790
(International Club)
Who's entertaining the machinery guy?

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.550
He Xiaohong?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.750
What's wrong?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.000
Tell her to lose some weight.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.270
Mr. Xu,

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.670
to each their own.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.480
Some people like that type.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.720
By the way,

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.480
the new beauty salon
just got a machine.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.840
You should try it sometime.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.030
Might do wonders for you.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.000
Alright. I'll go another time.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.240
Next week, aren't I going
to Hong Kong, China, with you?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.150
Right.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.270
Did Kevin send you
the hotel address yet?

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.960
Why is he dragging his feet this time?

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.030
Were you born in a barn?

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.440
I told her to come.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.110
Mr. Kevin booked the hotel.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.440
This is the address.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.200
Sir, anything else you need?

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.400
You're very well prepared.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.480
You even learned Cantonese.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.000
Just so-so.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.240
There's more preparation than that.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.440
Not bad.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.830
Very impressive.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:27.200
Don't tease me.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.270
Mr. Xu,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.400
so I won't be going to Hong Kong, China,
this time?

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.000
Cheers.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.350
Mr. Xu.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.920
Are you taking Qu Meng instead?

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.240
What exactly are you planning to do?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.680
She's stubborn.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.000
Lately, she's suddenly
been cooperative.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.270
Something's off.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.290
Take her to Hong Kong, China,

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.160
and make her disappear?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.270
What are you saying?

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.590
We're not gangsters.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.640
We want her to marry
some rich guy there.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.310
No.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.110
I brought Qu Meng in myself.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.440
Know your place!

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.640
Mr. Xu,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.310
at least tell me

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.350
what Qu Meng did wrong?

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.830
Someone knows about the tapes.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.680
I had Ming check.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.310
Over the past weeks,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.000
a few tapes have gone missing.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.070
Ming said

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.480
that Yang fellow is back.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.750
Boss.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.270
I can handle her.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.700
Just going to Hong Kong, China, huh?

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.650
Go if you like.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.790
Yang Wenyuan is back.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.510
Right?

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.830
Whatever you and Yang Wenyuan are doing,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.680
they already know.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.830
You think I didn't notice

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.960
that you told He Xiaohong
to steal the control room key,

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.550
didn't you?

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.680
Do you think,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.960
without me turning a blind eye,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.090
you could sneak out
for late-night supper every day?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.680
That you could stay out overnight?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.160
Ms. Hong...

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.550
You still call me Ms. Hong, huh?

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.390
If I hadn't pulled you out back then,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.190
would you be where you are today?

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.680
If not for me,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.240
would you be living like this?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.200
You and He Xiaohong.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.550
Do you have any conscience?

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.720
I remember everything you said.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.920
You said

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.160
no matter how bitter the past was,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.960
it was behind us.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.750
You said you brought us here

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.750
so we could live better lives.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.240
You said women could rely on themselves,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.790
have their own homes,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.590
and stop worrying about money.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.070
I remember all of it.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.960
But Ms. Hong,

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.000
I understand

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.960
you've been protecting me.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.350
The problem is

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.510
you can't just survive.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.500
What we're living now
isn't a good life either.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.160
You don't even know

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.680
what a good life is.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.880
Good food,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.510
good clothes, and plenty of money.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.590
That's not a good life.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.160
After Yang Wenyuan came into the club,

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.960
everything he said

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.440
and the poems he wrote

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.160
made us realize

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.350
there are better things

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.960
worth pursuing.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.750
You're too naive.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.640
I'm barely dragging myself
through this mire.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.680
What's wrong with
clinging to a little naivety?

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.720
That's all I've been holding on to.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.820
Without it,
I wouldn't have made it this far.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.880
I've thought it through.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.580
When the time comes,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.640
we'll sign your name too.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.030
You'll be listed as a victim like us.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.070
Stop dreaming.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.960
Get real.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.830
You're no match for them.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.750
If you want to stay alive,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.310
stop making trouble.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.790
They sent you here, right?

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.160
What did they ask you to do?

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.440
I'm protecting you.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.480
They've sent people over.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.200
They knew you'd warn him,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.880
so they sent me to stall you.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.480
I can't save everyone,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.480
but at least I can save you.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.240
(Qu Meng,)

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.030
(I'm sorry.)

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.310
(I chose)

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.440
(to take this final step.)

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.930
(I didn't want to put you on the spot.)

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.790
(So I didn't tell you.)

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.350
(A few days ago,
someone followed me at the bookstore.)

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.070
(I stayed alert)

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.780
(and didn't go back to our place.)

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.450
(Hello, smiling girl. Hello.)

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.470
(When you smile on the stage,
you blaze like fireworks,)

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.040
(lighting up the distant night
and this weathered age.)

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.640
(Hello, sad girl. Hello.)

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.260
(When you cry in the mire,
you're like a dagger,)

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:24.820
(piercing through beautiful lies
and a life in exile.)

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.590
(Do you remember?)

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.680
(The sky that night was so clear.)

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.680
(You said that if there were a future.)

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.680
(I didn't want to live
this life anymore.)

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.640
(You were right.)

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.270
(Don't cry, Qu Meng.)

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.960
(Remember)

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.830
(to behold)

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.200
(that light from a thousand years ago.)

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.220
(Liu Xueli, Shi Lan)

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.110
(Wake up.)

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.030
(Qu Meng.)

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.070
(Awaken from barren fences.)

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.200
(Set out.)

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.440
(Toward a new love.)

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.720
(Hello, silent gale.)

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:24.440
(Hello.)

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.880
(That fallen leaf)

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.400
(shatters the earth's stillness)

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.200
(with one last dance)

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.480
(and returns as new soil.)

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.790
(Hello, yesterday.)

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.750
(I died in broken dreams.)

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.680
(Hello, future.)

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.030
(I am reborn in new love.)

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.920
(Binchuan,)

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.160
(hello.)

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.000
(These are my final words.)

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.270
(The moment
the stone statue breaks open,)

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.270
(a soul is set free.)

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.590
(And in that moment,)

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.750
(I am free.)

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.070
(Maybe I carried too much sin,)

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.480
(and Heaven punishes me for it.)

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.920
(Before I breathe my last,)

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.310
(I write down everything I know.)

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.680
(I have no evidence,)

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.400
(but)

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.750
(I see the power of justice.)

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.110
(I see)

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.640
(the resolve of that young man)

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.200
(who risks everything
to find his family.)

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.240
(He)

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.680
(will prove it all.)

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.070
I only have half an hour.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.920
Get to the point.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.990
- What did you find?
- What did you find?

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.720
You go first.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.000
After you.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.030
What I'm about to say
might sound a bit unreal.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.750
That house in my dream.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.960
I think I can picture it clearly now.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.590
It's a two-story building.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.240
Two stories.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.350
Wooden structure.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.790
There seems to be

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.440
an electric fan constantly spinning.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.720
Oh, and the lights.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.160
The lights are special.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.550
Round and flashing.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.960
Like something you'd see in a disco.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.400
(A house.)

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.400
(When those women from the club
caused trouble,)

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.680
(they secretly rented a place outside.)

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.750
Usually, memories
from before the age of three

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.750
get wiped by the brain.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.550
So I don't know

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.480
whether my dream is a real memory
or something I made up.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.480
There's one thing

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.360
I do remember from my childhood.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.440
My mother told me

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.160
that when I felt lonely,

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.170
I should listen to the sounds
inside the statue.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.160
That must've been before I turned three.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.750
If it's not real.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.030
If it's just imagination,

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.750
then

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.640
isn't it even stranger
that you and I ran into each other?

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.640
So I believe you.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:57.980
And I believe in your dream too.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.830
These are the names

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.510
of the women who worked
at the club back then.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.330
That's roughly what I remember.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.480
They might not be exact.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:23.340
(He Xiaohong, Tiantian, Li Ting)

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.480
One of these names

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.160
is my mother's, right?

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.340
(East Exit D)

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.240
It's a two-story building.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.550
Two stories.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.440
Wooden structure.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.240
There seems to be an electric fan
constantly spinning.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.350
The lights are special.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.070
Round and flashing.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.830
Like something you'd see in a disco.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.000
Start with the lights.

00:31:17.131 --> 00:31:17.960
What's up?

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.240
Did you find something new?

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.310
That woman might've lived
in a building like this.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.070
These are fragments

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.510
from my memory.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.310
And this.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.680
What is this?

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.660
A name list of the International Club.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.790
It may not be accurate.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.110
You will

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.160

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.400
which name on here is my mother's,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.000
right?

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.880
Don't worry.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.440

I've been using your cab all this while.

This is the payment. Check it.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.160
No. I can't take your money.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.880
First, I should pay you.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.480
Second,

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.240
I need a favor.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.240
Go on.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.960
What's it, Feng?

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.880
This

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.240
might be hard.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.300
(Zhao Mengjie, Xie Lingwei, Qu Meng)
Can you try to dig out

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.480
their addresses

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.640
around 1990?

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.000
It was over twenty years ago.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.110
The names are the only thing I have.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.310
Take a look at these.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.640
These are something I drew
based on what I saw in my dream.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.270
There are a few versions.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.510
You can use them as a reference.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.070
That's even harder.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.110
Where am I supposed
to look for something

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.720
in a dream?

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.310
One of these names

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.310
might be my birth mother's.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.030
Dong,

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.200
do me this favor.

Please.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.550
I'll try,

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.630
but I can't promise anything.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.670
Have you seen this person?

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:19.800
Or anyone

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.320
who looks like this?

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.580
Excuse me. Have you seen
this person before?

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.960
Can you try to recall?

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.360
No.

How much do you know
about Gao Feng's mother?

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.710
I used to be your dad's driver.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.710
What I know is limited.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.400
