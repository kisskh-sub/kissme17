00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:57.600
Director Wang, morning.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.399
Morning.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.679
Since you're here,

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.840
help me with some work.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.840
No problem.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.320
I came here to learn from you.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.159
Here's the plan.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.439
I'll read,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.799
and you copy.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:10.519
Alright.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.560
Before 1980,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.120
Shenzhen's mangroves covered over 500 hectares.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:19.840
In 1984,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.239
a protected area was established,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.640
about over 300 hectares.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.799
That's still a lot left.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.959
In recent years,

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.040
due to land reclamation projects

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.040
and road construction,

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.400
they've been shrinking by 15

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.400
to 20 hectares annually.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.799
I know about those two things.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.599
By the end of 1991,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.799
the mangrove area was estimated to have shrunk drastically.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.920
Now, the mangroves in your Dasha Village

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.400
are only half of what they were.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.680
These are all expert findings.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.719
Do you think the situation is accurate?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.359
It should be about right.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.719
Director Wang,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.200
you say the root of all this

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.360
lies with these mangroves.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.080
I've thought of a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.360
permanent solution.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:12.800
Could we just

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.719
cut down all these mangroves?

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.800
We reclaim the land,

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.599
create a new environment.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.919
Enough.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.919
Let's stop here.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.439
A small token of appreciation.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.800
Our group's Director Jia asked me

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.919
to bring this to you.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.639
It's nothing valuable.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.000
I got it specially for you

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.719
from Hong Kong, China.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.719
Is this appropriate?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.360
It's not convenient here.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.560
Please,

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.400
deliver it to my home.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.080
My fault.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.439
I didn't think it through enough.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.520
I'll come over tonight.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.680
Do you know where this is?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.680
Director Wang's home.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.639
Home?

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.319
What he wrote for you is

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.599
the address of the Municipal Discipline and Inspection Committee.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.879
Looks like this path is blocked.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.360
I just don't understand.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.240
What's so un-eco-friendly about building?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.960
We're not opening factories or polluting.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.360
Which coastal place

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.199
doesn't reclaim land?

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.360
Only the mangroves are so darn precious.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.960
Director Jia,

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.919
there's a situation

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.919
I need to report to you.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.639
These past few days, I took my daughter

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.360
to the mangroves to look for mangrove frogs.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.400
You know, the croaking kind, those frogs.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.919
The result?

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.199
Not a single one.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.879
They used to be everywhere.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.080
Do you think this

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.120
has anything to do with the reclamation?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.199
What connection?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
People can move.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.199
Can't frogs move too?

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.080
Right, right, right.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.000
Believe me, Pengqian.

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.159
This sea must be reclaimed.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.560
The difference is,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.080
whether others do it or we do it.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.560
You go and get the villagers' signatures sorted.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.800
As for other matters,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.960
don't worry about them.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.680
What about that villagers' petition?

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.519
Is it done?

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.920
Don't ask. Still four short.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.279
The most troublesome one

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.079
is your cousin.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.600
Buy me a drink,

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.560
and I'll help you settle it.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.360
Really?

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.519
Good brother,

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:29.959
for life.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.000
Why look for mangrove frogs?

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.399
Last time,

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.199
when I came with Linlin,

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.519
we only found a dead one.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.800
I promised her

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800
I'd catch a live one for her to see.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.519
Where am I supposed to find one?

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.079
They're all gone.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.920
Chen Pengqian!

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.639
Director Wang!

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.639
What brings you here?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.720
Was this your doing?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.480
What?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.240
Look for yourself.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.920
Dumping construction waste into the mangroves.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.519
It's not just polluting the environment,

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.279
it's a crime.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.680
I didn't do this.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:57.879
Then why are you here?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.079
I just came to look for mangrove frogs.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.040
Look for frogs?

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.199
Ever since the mangroves

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.160
were polluted,

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.439
there have been no frogs for a long time.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:05.759
This matter

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.560
is inextricably linked to your company.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.000
I will hold them accountable to the end.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.319
Chen Pengqian,

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.120
this is your home.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:14.759
How can you do this?

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.759
Are you worthy of your ancestors?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.800
Unworthy descendant!

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.120
Is he crazy?

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.240
Who is this guy?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.439
Don't say that.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.240
He's a good person.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:34.480
An old revolutionary.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:40.680
I told them to dump it.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.480
He wants to protect

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.600
that muddy mangrove forest, right?

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:46.720
First, we'll give him a

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.600
"work error."

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.040
Then, wholeheartedly,

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:50.000
spend ten days or half a month

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.879
digging it all out.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.680
By then,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.879
the mangroves will be dead anyway.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.079
I'm just worried

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.199
Director Wang said

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.079
he'll investigate to the end.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.879
What do we do?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.680
I've got the fine money ready.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.439
Then there's no problem.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.639
How about those signatures?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.439
How many households left?

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.439
In principle, just one left.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.959
That's the toughest one.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.439
Give me some time.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.000
I'll definitely get it.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.079
Ah Peng.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.279
Ah Peng!

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.399
Tao'er.

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:31.160
Get me some water, Linlin.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.439
Have you eaten?

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.519
I've eaten.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.000
Drank a lot, huh?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.639
I'm your benefactor, you know.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.360
Listen,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.879
take this paper.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.639
Can I

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.920
work at your company?

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:48.480
Your cousin signed.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:49.439
The last one in the whole village.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.800
I got him.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.959
Our village is getting demolished!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.759
I'll live in an apartment!

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.879
I'll get a wife!

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.319
Dad.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.639
Will the mangroves be torn down too?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.000
Of course.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:02.079
Then when we have a new home,

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:04.240
won't the mangrove frogs have a home?

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:12.920
Now this matter

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.360
has reached the higher-ups.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.000
They're urgently calling a coordination meeting.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.000
Take that suit.

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:19.120
Go home and change.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.079
No need.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:21.439
The clothes you usually give me

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.319
are all fine.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.360
Tomorrow, as the villagers' representative,

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.439
you'll need to speak.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680
Dress more formally.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:29.759
Me? I have to speak?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.680
What should I say?

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.319
Say why you all signed.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.360
Say why we need land reclamation.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.120
Without reclamation,

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.360
how can we develop?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.639
How can ordinary people

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.959
live a good life?

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.279
Do I really need to teach you this?

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.600
Understood.

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:46.079
How was your

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.319
essay writing in middle school?

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.079
Should be okay, right?

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:50.439
I was the Chinese class

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.240
representative for a semester.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:52.199
Good.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.199
Go home today

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.399
and write a speech.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.639
Use genuine emotion.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.199
I'm good at that.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.639
Any word count requirement?

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:04.439
The more detailed, the better.

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:05.199
Okay.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.759
Pengqian.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.560
Wanting a good life isn't wrong.

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.000
After this is done,

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:14.800
the company won't treat you badly.

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:16.879
Director Jia.

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:19.040
You've been more than good to me.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:20.360
Thank you very much.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.920
Wanting a good life isn't wrong.

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:35.480
Ah Tao, then why

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.120
can't we see any mangrove frogs?

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.120
For two or three years now,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.120
haven't seen a single one.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.639
It's dead.

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:49.440
Then when we have a new home,

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.559
won't the mangrove frogs have a home?

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:55.240
Dumping construction waste in the mangroves

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:56.759
isn't just polluting the environment.

00:08:56.759 --> 00:08:57.559
It's a crime.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.279
This is your home.

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.120
How can you do this?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.240
Are you worthy of your ancestors?

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:14.320
Respected leaders,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.120
Let me ask you,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.120
where do you think you're going?

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:22.879
Who sent you?

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:23.519
Stop! Stop the car!

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.600
Who sent you?

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.240
What's wrong?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.960
Director Wang.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.240
A bunch of thugs have surrounded him.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.000
Stop! Stop!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.600
Alright, alright.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.120
Can't persuade a stubborn fool.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:33.480
No,

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.279
let's do him a favor.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.000
Be friends later.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.360
What favor?

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.120
How would you help?

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.519
He needs to be taught a lesson.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.440
Prepare your speech well.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.960
The coordination meeting won't wait.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.840
Chen Pengqian

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.600
This is your home.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.120
By doing this,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.240
are you worthy of your ancestors?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.360
Honorable leaders,

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:58.679
As developers,

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.000
we are, of course, very willing

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:01.759
to develop this land.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:05.039
We want to contribute to Shenzhen's development

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.639
and bring benefits to the people.

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:07.840
But the situation now is

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.799
that on one hand,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.120
there is government policy support.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.279
On the other hand,

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.159
we cannot force people against their will.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.120
This is the will

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.279
of the villager representatives and friends.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.639
Lao Wang, why are you so late?

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:25.159
I'm afraid some people

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:26.159
think I came too early.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
What's going on?

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.360
What the heck?

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:35.440
As a responsible enterprise,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.559
we have always placed

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:38.759
great importance on environmental protection.

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:40.600
The ecological report

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:41.759
on your desks

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.080
can fully prove

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.240
that the ecological value of the mangroves

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.919
has been severely overestimated.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.039
The mangroves

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.039
are considered by experts worldwide

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:51.000
to be the green lungs of the ocean.

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:53.559
This report

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:55.559
is simply turning black into white,

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:56.600
a pack of lies!

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.039
It says the pollution level

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.919
far exceeded the environment's capacity first,

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:01.120
and the mangroves' role

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:02.039
was weakened later.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.639
Alright, alright.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:03.000
If...

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.639
Alright.

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:04.720
If we can draw a line now...

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:05.919
Alright, alright, alright.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.679
Cutting down the mangroves is easy,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.200
restoring them is almost impossible.

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:11.000
The villagers signed

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.080
because they didn't know the truth.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.159
Your modification of the coastline

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.519
is completely criminal.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:16.759
We will never be accomplices.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.120
Dad,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.559
could this be

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:22.240
Shenzhen's last mangrove frog?

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.320
If the mangroves are there,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.200
then there must still be mangrove frogs.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.679
Don't you raise fish?

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:29.159
It doesn't make money.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:30.720
We need to find a way out.

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.320
Our family for generations

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:34.440
has relied on this field to live.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.399
I never thought

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:37.799
I would sell it.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.679
The teacher said

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:40.559
next time I should draw her a picture

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.679
of the mangroves full of mangrove frogs.

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:45.519
Chen Pengqian,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.440
you know very well what the situation is.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.240
Tell us the truth.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.000
Alright, alright.

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.440
Director Jia's willingness to actively build

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:54.440
Shenzhen

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.320
is clear to us.

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:56.799
The Environmental Protection Bureau's

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:57.799
desire to preserve that

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:59.399
mangrove forest

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:00.679
has also been received.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.879
Both sides' reasons

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:04.840
are very substantial.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.039
Xiao Chen.

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:07.960
Xiao Chen.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.399
Please continue speaking

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:13.600
about our villagers' will.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.559
I...

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.639
Continue.

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:17.919
I'm a bit flustered.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I don't know where to start.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.679
Can I... can I...

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:21.639
speak in dialect?

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:22.799
You may.

00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:34.399
Well...

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.159
There's a saying that goes,

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:38.080
"Live off the mountains, live off the sea."

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.559
Our Dasha Village is by the sea.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.120
We're all called fishermen.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.840
I heard that in Fujian,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.480
what do the fishermen worship?

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.679
They worship Mazu.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.600
Right?

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.200
I've always been thinking,

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.399
in our Dasha Village,

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:52.919
what is the god in our hearts?

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:53.559
What is it?

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.679
I suddenly remembered my grandfather.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:57.639
He once told me,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.519
he said Dasha Village is amazing.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.759
Although it's by the sea,

00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:03.039
every year in Shenzhen, no matter

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.799
how strong the wind, rain, or waves are,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.879
our Dasha Village

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.159
has never been affected.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.440
Yes, yes.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.559
He said he knew since he was a child

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.159
that at the village entrance by the sea,

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.679
there was a large mangrove forest.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.279
The mangrove roots are deep.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.399
No matter how big the storm,

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:20.799
you can't blow them down.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:22.159
Those trees are dense

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:23.039
and can block

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.679
all foreign invasion.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.679
So since he was a child,

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:27.840
sometimes during holidays,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.200
he would light incense

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.519
and say thank you,

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:32.080
mangroves, for protecting us.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:33.360
So I was thinking,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.399
can the mangroves be considered

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.720
the god in our hearts?

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:37.519
Well said.

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.320
Everyone, wait a moment.

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:41.279
The meaning of what you just said,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.240
I understand.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:43.399
But,

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.679
your upcoming statement,

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:47.000
can it represent

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.559
the will of the entire village?

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.960
I watched Ah Peng grow up.

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:00.799
What he says,

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.080
I believe.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:03.960
He

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.200
can represent our whole village.

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:08.639
Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:11.000
So your meaning is...

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:22.440
Among all the villages in Shenzhen,

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:23.919
Dasha Village's economy

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.679
is not considered developed.

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:27.039
I know

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:29.200
this land reclamation project

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:31.440
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:33.840
for us, the people of Dasha Village.

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:36.519
Therefore, if our village

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:38.440
needs to relocate entirely,

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.200
we are all willing.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:44.120
If, for the sake of development,

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:45.799
land reclamation is needed in Dasha Village,

00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:47.240
our entire village

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.279
is also willing.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.360
But if, because of reclamation,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.919
they want to dig up

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:56.480
this mangrove forest

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:59.360
that has protected us for centuries,

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.000
I think

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.639
I would not agree.

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:09.919
We, the people of Dasha Village,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.720
are a hundred times against it!

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:13.559
No! No! No!

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.759
No! No! No!

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.279
We must protect our mangroves!

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.080
No! No! No!

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.399
Ah Peng is right!

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:26.200
We cannot be without the mangroves!

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:27.799
We cannot be without the mangroves!

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.360
After the coordination meeting,

00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:39.240
the mangroves were preserved.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.559
Our village also moved

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.440
into new buildings with better conditions.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.039
To this day,

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:51.200
we still guard this mangrove forest,

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:53.440
guarding our home.
