[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.710
[Episode 14]

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.170
These clothes are so trashy.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.120
I got hangnails.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.640
What's all this stuff?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.509
It's filthy.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.790
The food is so awful.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.350
Even my servants wouldn't eat this.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.410
Exactly.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.430
Wasn't our life in the celestial mountain
supposed to be enjoyable?

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.840
We became laborers instead.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.640
We were promised eternal youth.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.120
But my skin is visibly getting worse.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.040
Are you still eating?

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.920
If not, I'll take it all.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.840
Go ahead.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.220
What do you think

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.960
the next trial is about?

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.079
The first one was already so difficult.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.120
I heard it's about needlework.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.710
It's to see whose clothes

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.190
can satisfy Dreamshard Immortal.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.960
I heard it's a test of skills.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.840
We have to master
etiquette, music, riding, and archery.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.550
Oh, no.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.590
I'm not proficient in any of these arts.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.079
It doesn't matter
if you're not proficient in them.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.410
Didn't the immortal say

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.630
that anyone who passed the first trial

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.590
could already stay in
the Realm of Mist and Void

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.390
and do chores?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.400
What?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.280
What?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.800
I've come a long way to be here.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.870
Instead of enjoying life at home,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.470
I came here just to do chores?

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.280
Exactly.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.900
How can I do chores?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.560
It's dirty and exhausting.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.430
I...

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.470
Whatever the second trial involves,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.750
it demands both physical strength
and mental effort.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.210
Make sure you're well-fed

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.280
and well-rested.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.480
That's better than useless speculation.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.310
Look.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.240
It looks worse.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.530
What's wrong?

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.680
The scar on Pianpian's face
is much more inflamed.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.280
This is your doing, isn't it?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.630
Don't talk nonsense.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.079
That was the immortal dew
bestowed by Immortal Lord.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.280
Even though it was bestowed
by Immortal Lord,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280
you must have added something to it.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.720
Tell me. What did you add?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.930
Don't tell anyone else.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.280
Say it.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.470
I just

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.460
added some oleander sap

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.240
and datura nectar.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.890
The worst of her suffering

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.360
is yet to come.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.000
Even if she's in agony,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.570
she wouldn't dare ask Immortal Lord.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.930
She could only express gratitude.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.570
What's wrong with you?

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.630
What happened to your face?

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.290
It looks like it was poisoned.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.360
I'm fine.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.190
If this wound isn't cleaned promptly,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.790
the scar will become deeper.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.560
What does it matter
if it's deep or shallow?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.720
It's just an outer covering.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.690
A woman should cherish her appearance.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.500
Have you made up your mind?

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.140
Serve Immortal Lord.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.920
Bearing the vengeance
for my family and country,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.580
I slew demons for the human realm.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.680
But now, I'm being asked

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.430
to help demons hurt humans.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.150
How could I possibly agree?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.980
There's no real difference, actually.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.090
In the human realm, you slay demons

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.480
to earn the Emperor's favor

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.060
for promotion and titles.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.600
Even with bad luck,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.840
you could still rely on
the Feiyu Guard's name

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.680
to make life easier.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.670
In the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.750
as long as you please Immortal Lord,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.600
you can also earn favor.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.070
If not,

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.680
you can just obey orders and survive.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.920
As long as you avoid disobedience,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.750
mistakes,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.530
and affections,

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.330
you can still keep your miserable life.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.010
Different positions,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.580
but the same point.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.310
But I slay demons

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.190
for righteousness

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720
and the people.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.180
All these years
in the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.170
the people I've seen

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.680
have been enough
to make me lose faith in human nature.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.310
In the human realm, you must have faced

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.750
far more than I have.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.510
How can you still be so naive?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.870
Human nature

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.270
has its greed and depravity,

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.920
but there's also ultimate sacrifice.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.130
I've seen both the utmost wickedness

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.680
and the purest kindness.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.240
It seems

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.600
that you've been confined too long
in the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.650
If one day

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.250
you have the chance,

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.680
you should go out

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.200
and see the vast world.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.289
You can't even save yourself,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.990
yet you still worry about me?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.510
This is Lu's wish.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.130
From the moment I entered
the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.630
I never expected to leave alive.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.640
I've told you all I needed to say to you.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.110
I'll try my best to buy you more time.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.740
But if Immortal Lord loses patience,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.960
you and Tan'er

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.340
will have no chance of regret.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.960
The wound on your face

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.910
looks more inflamed than it did last time.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.800
Were you poisoned?

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.680
Take some petals

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.680
of roses and trumpet vines,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.680
crush them, and apply them to the wound.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.440
It'll reduce swelling and remove toxins.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.680
I've seen

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.360
both types of flowers on the island.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.150
Thank you.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.380
I was just about to look for you.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.180
This is for you.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:10.980
This...

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.090
What's this?

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.720
It's ointment made from

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.670
5 types of flower petals.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.440
It promotes blood circulation,
removes blood stasis

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.750
clears heat, and removes toxins.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.950
Apply it to your face,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.800
and your wound will heal faster.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.720
Why are you

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.480
being so nice to me?

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.940
Although you're from
the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.100
I can see

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.160
that you still have a kind heart.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.210
Besides, I picked these flowers here.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.450
It's no bother at all.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.930
No wonder Hong Ye cares for you so deeply.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.990
You truly deserve it.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.350
Hurry up and apply it.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.640
These dishes again.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:06.860
I'm so sick of it.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.670
When is the second trial going to begin?

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.960
Yes.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.510
It's like a knife hanging above our necks,

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.480
never falling,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.070
yet terrifying enough
to scare us to death.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.870
Dali.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.750
In the second trial,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.790
can I follow you?

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.590
I think you'll definitely pass.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.280
Why do you think I'll definitely pass?

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.440
If only one of us

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.840
can pass,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.270
it must be you.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.510
Can I follow you?

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.320
Sure.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.040
Xiao Yao.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.840
If only one person

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.300
can pass the second trial,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.240
that must be me.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.390
Good luck.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.620
Immortal Lord, I pray for your blessing.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.120
If I can successfully pass the trial,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.280
I'll devote myself completely,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.200
being your most outstanding disciple.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.000
Little Leaf.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.000
In the second trial,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.670
you must protect Xiao Yao.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.560
Among thousands of flowers
in the flower sea,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.160
why are you the most special one?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.120
How do you have so much water?

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.080
When you were a human being,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.680
you must have been a crybaby.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.150
Xiao Yao.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.240
The wound on your face looks much better.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.630
Yes.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.370
Thank you for your ointment.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.110
I came to tell you

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.510
that the second trial
begins tomorrow at 9 p.m.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.110
in the east courtyard
of the Biexin Courtyard.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.340
The second trial

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.670
is full of mechanisms.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.510
No one has ever passed it before.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.270
Consider carefully
whether you want to participate.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:35.870
Thank you.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.920
What's that sound?

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.440
It's so creepy.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.100
This place is called
the Courtyard of Summoned Mysteries.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.030
It's normally closed to everyone.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.270
Previously,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.720
a woman

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.240
was betrayed by her companion

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.770
and died in this courtyard.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.870
Because her resentment was so deep,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.790
her vengeful spirit never dispersed.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.630
This place

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.200
is like a stubborn miasma
of the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.240
Your trial

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.800
is to find a way to dispel
the vengeful spirit's resentment.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.910
Once the trial begins,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.630
the gate of the Courtyard of Mysteries
will only open again

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.790
when the vengeful spirit disperses.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.550
If the resentment isn't dispelled,

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.610
will the door remain closed forever?

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.270
Not necessarily.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.370
If you all die,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.250
the gate will open as well.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.480
-What should we do? Let's go home.
-It's okay. This wall isn't high.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.080
At worst,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.210
we can climb over it.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.810
You can try.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.630
You should think carefully.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.390
If you give up now,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.300
you can still be a kitchen maid
on the island.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.380
However,

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.310
you won't have the honor
of serving Immortal Lord at her side.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:00.790
This…

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.270
This…

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.990
If someone is late,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.960
does it count as giving up?

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.560
I'll give you 30 minutes to consider.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.240
Once the trial begins,

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.400
no one

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.750
will be able to enter or leave
the Courtyard of Mysteries.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.200
She's stalling for time,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.000
clearly waiting for Xiao Yao.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.550
Dali.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.680
I'd never left my chamber before.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.960
I'm as weak as a kitten.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.600
Can I follow you this time?

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.100
Dali.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.720
This bracelet was bestowed on me
by the Empress.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.320
It's the only one of its kind.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.750
I'd like to give it to you

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.810
as a token of our sworn sisterhood.
Would you accept it?

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.610
If it doesn't fit, then forget it.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.520
It fits well.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.000
This bracelet suits you well.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.510
Dali.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.440
Dali.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.030
Dali, you're so clever.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.000
You'll definitely find a way.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.720
Dali.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.840
Exactly.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.200
Then

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.550
you'll have to listen to me later.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:58.880
Okay.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.720
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.400
I'm not late, am I?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.790
I thought you didn't want
to participate in the trial.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.790
How could that be?

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.490
I believe in myself, my friends,

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.020
but not in fate.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.170
Someone claimed that I would lose.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.830
So I'm determined to prove her wrong.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.340
It's time.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.370
All of you are in the courtyard,

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.240
so you've all decided
to participate in the trial?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.960
Very good.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.070
Each of you has already
distinguished yourself among a hundred.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.440
However, in this trial,

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.830
rewards will be given based on merit.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.630
Only one with the greatest merit

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.650
will earn Immortal Lord's favor.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.750
The trial begins now.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.340
Before this candle burns out,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.750
if you still can't
put the vengeful spirit to rest,

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.070
you'll remain here with her forever.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.400
This...

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.030
This...

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.400
Take care, everyone.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.440
The candle!

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.730
Hurry up. Come and protect the candle.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.200
You cover this side.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.900
Just guarding it like this
isn't a solution.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.310
What do you want to do?

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:01.890
What are you doing?

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.960
Put it back.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.750
If the candle goes out,
the task will also be count a failure.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.270
Exactly.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.790
Exactly.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.850
You... Why are you taking the candle?

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.680
Put the candle down.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.200
Or you'll get us all killed.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:12.800
Come back!

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.560
Xiao Yao!

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.640
Come back!

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.880
Come back quickly!

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.790
Xiao Yao!

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.580
Hurry back!

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.860
Come back now!

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.000
The candle must not go out.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.330
What is she trying to do?

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.200
What's she doing?

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.750
Xiao Yao!

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.350
Xiao Yao!

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.920
Xiao Yao!

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.520
There's clearly a door here.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.540
What should we do, Dali?

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.520
Let's see what she's going to do.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.920
What is she trying to do?

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.570
Right.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.750
Xiao Yao, be careful!

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.220
It's so scary.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.020
There's a door here. Come over.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.000
There's a door. Look!

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.800
That's great!

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.670
Slow down.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.560
Take it slow.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.080
-Be careful.
-Watch your step.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.110
Dali!

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.900
Dali. I'm scared.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.590
Let's all hold hands.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.860
Don't get separated.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.240
Dali.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.250
Dali.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.000
What's wrong?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.880
What's wrong, Dali?

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.540
Dali.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.480
Dali.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.270
All of you come in.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.940
Let's go.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.170
Have them hold hands.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.920
Hold hands.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.480
Give me your hand.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.110
Be careful.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.710
Slow down.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.660
Easy.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.330
Watch out for the steps.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.090
There are steps.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.440
Careful.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.430
Stay closer.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.680
Seems like the trap was set too easy.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.500
It doesn't matter.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.490
This is just the beginning.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.880
Move.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.030
Why aren't you moving?

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.030
I want to move.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.120
But I can't!

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.080
Why are your hands so sweaty?

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.110
It's disgusting.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.790
I'm sorry.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.880
Hurry up.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.510
Move quickly!

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.660
Come on!

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.590
Hurry!

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.490
Quick!

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.410
If you want to get out, shut up.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.590
Girl, don't panic.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.310
First, lean against the wall.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.400
Take a deep breath.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.930
Turn sideways and come slowly.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.000
Go.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.990
Come on.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.000
Careful.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.640
Slowly.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.400
Watch out!

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:34.930
Be careful.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.550
They're lit.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.350
It's working!

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:05.960
They lit up!

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.690
It's bright!

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.930
It's bright!

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.760
Great!

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.620
Let's go.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:33.960
Don't block the way.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.550
I'm sorry.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.370
You look unfamiliar.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.640
What's your name?

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.750
My name is Huang Ying.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.350
Such a vulgar name.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.400
You must be from a humble family.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.640
As a woman,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.830
how did you let yourself get so fat?

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.350
You have no regard for your appearance.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.790
What rank is your father?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.090
Where does he serve?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.480
My father is highly
favored by His Majesty,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.800
but

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.550
I'm born of a concubine.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.430
It was my mother...

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.110
My mother raised me all by herself.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.770
No wonder you look so unsophisticated.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.680
My father holds a second-rank position.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.000
I've seen plenty of children like you—

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.310
born to lowborn women.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.500
Your mother must be just a lowly servant.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.400
Your mouth

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.110
is filthier than a latrine.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.960
Say that again.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.690
I'll say it again just the same.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.960
You pride yourself on your noble birth,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.880
yet your view
of the world is painfully narrow.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.480
Every day you just flaunt
your family status

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.400
and throw your weight around.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.590
In reality, you're just a parasite,
living off others.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.480
You lowborn trash,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.830
how dare you speak to me disrespectfully!

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.030
Just try to touch me.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.110
I know demonic arts.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.850
It's all your fault!

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.160
Your stupidity is holding everyone back.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.840
Are you okay?

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.750
Why didn't you dodge?

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.660
I'm fine.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.200
I'm used to it.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.480
Hit back.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.670
If Huang Ying hits back,

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:05.800
it would be one slap.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.000
If I do it for her,

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.590
who knows how many hits it would be?

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.720
Which do you choose?

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.200
Do you want to hit back yourself

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.530
or should I do it for you?

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.630
I'm fine.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:18.920
Really, I'm fine.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.350
You don't need to stand up for me.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.770
Apologize now.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.580
I'm sorry.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.500
What's that sound?

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.790
The cry

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.970
comes from this zither.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.430
[Wu]

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.290
[Gong]

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.330
Everyone be careful!
Don't get hit by the light beams!

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.270
[Wu]

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.310
The Realm of Mist and Void

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.270
hasn't been this lively for a long time.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.000
The way to solve this mechanism

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.160
is within this deadly formation.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.810
If they remain agitated,

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.380
it will be hard to discover.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.280
[Jue]

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.490
[Zhi]

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.000
Watch out!

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:19.770
Xiao Yao!

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.290
Help me, please!

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.710
Come on. Listen to me now.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:29.790
Put your foot here.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.060
You can place your hand here.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.130
Give me that hand.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.930
Duck your head.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:35.790
Lean sideways.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.740
One, two, three.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:41.810
Good. Let's go.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.500
This zither needs to drink blood.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.970
How do you know that?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
When the light beam
was absorbing blood just now,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.800
strings appeared on the zither.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.820
So this zither must be the key.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.960
It needs to drink blood to be complete.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.590
However,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.660
the blood it absorbed earlier
was too little

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.440
to produce new strings.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.450
Xiao Yao,

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.170
the two missing strings on the zither

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.480
must be found among these light beams.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.030
I've been sickly since childhood

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.350
with a lack of energy and blood.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.030
She who donates some

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.200
can have all my silver and gold.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.850
What's the use of wealth when one's dead?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.030
We must break this deadlock.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.860
Since we all came here together,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.290
why don't we each contribute some blood?

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.640
Sounds about right.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.820
Who goes first?

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.800
Let's go by
our fathers' or brothers' official ranks,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.600
from lowest to highest,

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.640
starting with those
related to low-level officials.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.540
What if the blood from the first few
is enough?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.200
Then those who haven't donated

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.200
will profit without making an effort,
right?

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.890
The Immortal Lord will assess us
based on our merits.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.550
Have you forgotten that rule?

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.250
But...

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.930
You go first!

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.670
My face!

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.470
I must've been disfigured!

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.510
No, it's not true.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.940
Your face is fine.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.710
Are you even human?

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.920
Her brother rose to power

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.380
with my father's support.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.930
Let's say her blood

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.440
is a token of gratitude.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.880
More blood is needed.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.410
You're next!

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.270
I'm not going!

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.000
But you must!

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:44.830
No!

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:45.410
Just go!

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.310
Enough!

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.910
Off you go!

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.920
This place is already haunted
by a vengeful spirit.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.620
Don't you want a few more around?

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.680
We must figure out
how these mechanisms work,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.920
or we'll all end up dead here.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.450
That doesn't justify
taking a person's life!

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.410
Let's think of something else.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.130
I don't want to die.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.590
Dali, what should we do?

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.030
These light beams are coming the mirrors.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.300
There must be something special
about these mirrors.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.180
[Zhi]

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.530
[Jue]

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.340
Dali, please think of something!

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200
What should we do?

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.500
I want to go home.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.350
Gong.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.070
Shang.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.830
Jue.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:35.590
Zhi.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.110
Wu.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.920
Wen.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.200
Yu.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.420
These 7 characters
are related to the guqin.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.170
You're quite knowledgeable.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.310
You bet I am.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.090
Let me check it out.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.720
Be careful, Xiao Yao.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.550
Think of something!

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.160
What should we do?

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.750
Yeah, Dali.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.960
It's so scary here.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.060
[Gong]

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.170
Can someone

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.550
look at the characters on those mirrors?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.580
Those mirrors?

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.240
I'll go!

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:10.440
Let's go.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.650
Come help me.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.310
Look.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.160
It looks like the character "Shang,"
the second note of the Pentatonic scale.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.550
The second one appears to be Jue,
the third note.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.280
The one after that seems like Zhi,
the fifth note.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.110
Indeed,

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.400
the mirror corresponds
to the seven zither strings:

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.000
Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, Yu, Wen, Wu...

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.750
[Gong]

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.350
Watch out!

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.480
What are you trying to do?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.790
You'll get us all killed!

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.930
This mechanism is treacherous—

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.940
if you match mirrors
with the same character,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.030
but with one of them flipped
to its other side,

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.350
it will shift

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.330
all the mirrors

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.930
and change the light beams.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.480
Moving the mirrors requires two people
working together.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.790
Now, who among you
is willing to step up,

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.510
turn that "Gong" mirror

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.610
to face my side,

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.340
and gamble with me on this?

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.720
This mechanism

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.740
can only be solved
only if everyone works together.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.490
No matter how clever
and capable Xiao Yao is,

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.440
it's useless

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.700
if she's held back by them.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.510
They've always been
suspicious and exclusive,

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.780
each lost in their own calculations—

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.230
scattered and divided.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.090
No wonder they're trapped in this array.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.000
I'll do it!

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.530
Xiao Yao,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.880
if it hadn't been for you earlier,

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.280
I'd be dead already.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.520
I'll take this gamble with you.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:08.920
Be careful.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.409
Xiao Yao.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:26.590
[Gong]

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.110
[Gong]

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:38.520
[Gong]

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.900
It worked!

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.929
The light beams are gone.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:46.880
Next one.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.330
[Shang]

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.530
I can't reach it, Xiao Yao.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.510
This…

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.510
Dali,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.120
what should we do?

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:28.080
[Shang]

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.040
[Shang]

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.940
Great!

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.080
[Jue]

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.590
[Jue]

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.180
[Yu]

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.950
[Wen]

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.340
[Wu]

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.340
They cleared it this fast?

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.690
In previous trials,

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.710
71% couldn't get past this point.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.110
Who said they cleared it?

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.630
If it were just the same old routine,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.240
wouldn't that be boring?

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.220
We added some new twists—

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.320
just wait for what comes next.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.440
All human hearts are scheming,

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.110
rife with deceit

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.000
and selfish gain—

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.960
who pities the souls
that died wronged?

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.820
They yearn to break their chains,

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.680
to find in a song's final note
their lasting peace.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.680
She wants to hear a melody
that can soothe her resentment.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.230
What's so hard about that?

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.230
I used to listen
to the birds sing every day—

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.090
I know plenty of lovely melodies.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.880
But the zither strings
aren't all gathered yet—

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.070
how can we play anything good?

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.070
Wait!

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.920
Stop, Dali!

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.220
I can't stop!

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.500
Oh no,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.360
the candles are about to go out!

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.800
Mind the candles!

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.770
Be careful!

00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.360
Xiao Yao!

00:37:59.360 --> 00:37:59.840
Watch out!

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.550
Look out!

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.110
Make Dali stop now!

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.710
It hurts!

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.440
Help her!

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.330
Slow down!

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.400
Are you okay?

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:16.990
Dali!

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.600
Time to serve

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.590
the extra course.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.840
Xiao Yao!

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.250
Xiao Yao!

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.650
Xiao Yao!

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.660
What do we do, Xiao Yao?

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.280
Dali!
