cannot be kept.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.600
The Emperor has issued an edict.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.840
He killed our father.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.200
One of us has to die.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.200
The killer was the Emperor.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.520

I want to go home.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.480
I'll go with you.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.240
Zhifeng,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.040

something bad happens to me,

remember this.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.040
Dig up this box.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160
Find a chance

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.520
to give what's inside

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.840
to the Emperor.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.000
Do you understand?

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.240
This is evidence of exam fraud

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.440
discovered by my father.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.360

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.880
(was framed and our family was executed)

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.160
