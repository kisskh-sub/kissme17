WEBVTT

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.780
Stay away!

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.460
Stay away!

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.580
Stay away from me!

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.100
No!

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.100
It's not me.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.130
I didn't kill him.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.100
It wasn't me.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.940
It wasn't me!

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.820
It wasn't me!

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.780
I told you I'm not the killer!

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.730
It wasn't me!

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.660
It wasn't me!

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.450
I beg you!

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.060
Don't arrest me!

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.660
It's not me!

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.690
I've never killed anyone!

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.500
She's not the killer.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.770
Her shoulders

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.380
don't line up right.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.300
And when she gets nervous,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.300
her left hand

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.100
has involuntary spasms.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.730
That's a typical sign

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.450
of congenital nerve palsy.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.610
The one we're looking for

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.890
must have the physique

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.650
and strength to move

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.930
Jiang Fei's body.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.930
But a person

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.930
with nerve palsy

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.260
could never

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.650
handle Jiang Fei's body alone.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.580
I'll go ask.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.820
Han Feng!

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.980
What is it?

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.610
I suspect

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.420
that someone tampered with Jiang Fei's

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.210
autopsy report.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.100
What do you mean?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.170
How long have you been here?

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.330
How does it relate to the case?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.290
The killer staged this,

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.700
trying to mislead us

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.970
about the assessment

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.180
of the cause of death.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.770
But meanwhile,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.740
they also exposed their characteristics.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.620
They know pharmacology, anatomy...

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.450
even the case-handling

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.180
procedures

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.330
of our department.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.140
They even have

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.330
access to the case files.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.450
Only people within the department

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.180
can match these characteristics.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.450
You're saying

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.140
the murderer is one of us?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.040
Ms. Zhao,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.470
you'd still have to help with

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.910
the toxicology testing.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.080
Thanks to you, Mr. Qi,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.160
my work will be a lot

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.160
easier in the future,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.600
and I will have fewer night shifts.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.310
Thank you.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.400
No, thank you.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.310
I'll go sort the drug samples.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.280
Mr. Qi,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.470
I'll go prepare

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.550
the freezer for the body

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.910
and fill out the autopsy report.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.840
No need.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.870
I'll fill out the report.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.400
You go store the body.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.180
Okay.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.380
Mr. Qi,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.890
I'm staying to document it.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.180
I'll deliver the body later.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.140
Jiang Fei is dead.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.940
She saw my name

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.500
on the body.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.500
The body has been disturbed.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.260
You mean

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.620
before he died,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.580
he wrote the murderer's name on his body

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.650
with invisible ink,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.090
but it was erased.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.090
Yes.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.770
Moreover, the black light
photos that Lanzi took

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.490
were also deleted.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.180
It's Eva.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.140
Is your English name Eva?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.210
It was Jiang Fei

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.330
who gave me the name Eva.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.890
Whenever he took me out,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.290
he'd tell everyone that I was Eva.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.700
And he made me wear that Lolita dress.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.940
He bought me that dress.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.450
He also gave me money and gifts.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.180
I have no reason to kill him.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.210
His death won't do me any good.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.530
That night when you
met Jiang Fei at the bar,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.060
you claimed he had a cold and

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.940
took cephalosporin?

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.140
Yes.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.970
Where is the cephalosporin?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.020
I took it.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.020
It should be

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.580
on the lab table right now.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.410
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.860
Did it match the drug in Jiang Fei?

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.860
Before, we assessed the cause
of Jiang Fei's death

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.980
to be acute heart failure
from alcohol intoxication

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.460
and a disulfiram-like reaction.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.650
But we just tested the cephalosporin.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.620
In it, we found no

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.260
methyltetrazole group.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.410
Put it simply.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.220
Not all cephalosporins

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.740
cause a disulfiram-like reaction.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.930
Only those with methyltetrazole groups

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.770
would trigger it.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.810
So Zhang Lu's medicine isn't the cause.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.690
Yes.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.500
Did we find another box of cephalosporin

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.020
in Jiang Fei's house?

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.860
Yes.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.690
That opened box contains

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.100
methyltetrazole groups.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.930
That's why we identified the cause

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.220
as an acute heart failure.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.020
Yes.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.410
Jiang Fei was frozen to death.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.340
The murderer wanted to make us believe

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.860
that it was an accidental death.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.100
If Zhang Lu were really the killer,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.220
she wouldn't have told us

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.500
Jiang Fei took the meds.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.370
That would only overturn
the theory of accidental death.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.020
Keep investigating.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.530
Okay.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.690
You can see from this angle

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.260
that Jiang Fei and Zhang Lu were here.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.100
Jiang Fei did take some meds before her.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.500
But we can't see clearly

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.460
what they exactly are.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.380
Zoom in.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.620
That box in Zhang Lu's hands is

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.740
the same one in the lab.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.170
So she didn't lie.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.230
A disulfiram-like reaction was also

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.530
detected in Jiang Fei's body.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.270
If this box wasn't the cause,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.020
the culprit must have made him

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.410
take another box at some point.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.890
Play it again.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.380
Mr. Qi.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.380
I just found the test Lanzi was

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.380
running before she died.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.460
Seems like she was
separating a drug formula.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.460
Were you asking her to run a comparison?

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.860
Raw Diamond?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.410
Did you test it?

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.930
It was already listed
as a major investigation project.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.140
It's also within scope.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.690
But it's not detected.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.810
Where's Li Yiqi's blood sample?

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.890
Li Yiqi?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.340
Do you think Li Yiqi's case

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.220
is connected to Lanzi and Jiang Fei's?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.220
Stop.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.220
Rewind.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.930
Play it again.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:10:59.930
One's left-handed.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.650
One's right-handed.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.170
This is not Zhang Lu.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.740
No, wait.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.500
Then why did the blood
from Jiang Fei's house

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.100
match Zhang Lu's?

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.220
Mr. Qi.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.650
Han Feng.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.810
- Where's Gao Yuan?
- Where's he?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.770
Gao Yuan!

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.170
Ms. Zhu, Mr. Han,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.810
what's wrong?

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.290
Did you handle the blood sample

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.020
of Jiang Fei's case?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.140
No, not me.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.410
What about the drug test?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.620
None of the tests

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.100
on this case

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.740
were done by me.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.260
Is there something wrong with

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.890
the blood test?

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:49.860
The results are in.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.380
It's her.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.890
Where's Ms. Zhao right now?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.220
This is your daughter Zhao Yiwa's

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.020
transfer application.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.650
Please sign your name.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.500
The blood comparison results are in.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.860
It's clean this time.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.340
Ms. Zhao,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.020
I didn't expect

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.740
to see you here in this way.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.690
The test results are in.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.380
Your blood

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.020
matches the blood we found

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.770
at Jiang Fei's house.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.410
You killed Jiang Fei

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.740
for your daughter,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.100
Zhao Yiwa, right?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.260
I arrested Jiang Fei before.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.460
He sold a drug

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.460
called Raw Diamond,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.620
causing many deaths.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.220
We did our research.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.170
You worked in Li City before.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.290
Your daughter was 16 then.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.620
She once attempted suicide,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.500
cutting her wrists.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.890
Though found

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.770
and rescued,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.380
she fell into a coma.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.620
And in her system,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.020
large quantities of drugs were detected.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.810
The main one was Raw Diamond.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.530
Have you heard of a drug

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.410
called Raw Diamond?

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.340
I've examined many bodies before,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.290
all died from it.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.020
The last one I remember

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.380
was a 16-year-old girl

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.690
who got brain damage

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.740
and turned vegetative

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.810
from taking Raw Diamond.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.980
It was on the day that

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.170
you heard Jiang Fei's name.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.100
Jiang Fei has no

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.380
fixed residence.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.380
As for where he is now,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.050
you'll have

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.100
to look into it.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.170
You impersonated Zhang Lu,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.530
got close to Jiang Fei,

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.690
and found the chance to drug him.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.140
One's left-handed.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.930
One's right-handed.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.380
This is not Zhang Lu.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.410
You coaxed Jiang Fei at the bar

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.480
into taking the meds.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.220
After we arrested Zhang Lu,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.220
you used your position

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.410
to frame Zhang Lu

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.220
to clear your own name,

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.340
am I right?

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.260
If Zhang Lu's blood matches

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.340
the blood sample we collected

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.570
from Jiang Fei's house,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.570
she's most likely

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.220
the one who killed him.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.650
You swapped Zhang Lu's blood

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.770
with the blood sample from

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.530
Jiang Fei's house,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.020
framing her as the killer.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.020
You did all this

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.380
to cover the fact that

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.290
you killed Jiang Fei.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.170
So Jiang Fei's time of death

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.530
was around 4 AM.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.460
I've checked.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.180
There was no power outage that night.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.260
The killer must

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.900
take the knife away from the scene.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.330
That means...

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.460
That knife wasn't stabbed at the victim.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.460
It was the killer.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.810
Do you remember Zhao Yiwa?

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.460
Did you find a knife on the site?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.180
The forensic team collected many

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.700
incomplete and disordered fingerprints.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.290
We assume that most of them

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.330
are traces of daily life.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.810
During the autopsy, you found

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.700
the name written on Jiang Fei's wrist.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.460
You killed Qiu Lanzi because

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.090
she saw the name Eva, right?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.530
You were worried that
once we found out about it,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.090
it'd trace to your daughter Zhao Yiwa

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.980
and expose your motive for murder.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.980
If you got caught,

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.980
you wouldn't be able
to take your daughter

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.130
to seek other treatment abroad.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.370
It was also you who deleted
the photos in the camera, right?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.370
To keep the secret,

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.370
you put potassium cyanide
into Qiu Lanzi's stomach medicine

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.530
and killed her.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.220
Jiang Fei caused my daughter's death.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.180
He deserved it.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.180
What about Zhang Lu?

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.220
Don't you feel guilty about

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.740
framing someone innocent?

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.660
And also Qiu Lanzi.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.700
What did she do wrong?

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.050
She was simply doing

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.180
her job as a forensic pathologist.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.810
Why did she deserve to die?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.700
It wasn't only Jiang Fei

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.420
who killed your daughter.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.290
She's a good doctor.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:26.500
She saves other people,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.700
but never has time for me.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.700
This was your daughter's last post

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.900
before she committed suicide.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.090
She's a good doctor.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.740
She saves other people,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.090
but never has time for me.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.780
Thanks, Mr. Han.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.100
Jiang Fei's case is finally solved.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.570
I haven't treated everyone

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.130
to a meal since I came to He City.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.340
I'll treat you guys

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.610
to send Qiu Lanzi off in a few days.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.340
Then I'll thank you
on everyone's behalf.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:07.770
By the way,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.250
please thank Mr. Qi for me.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.860
He worked hard for Qiu Lanzi's case.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.080
I know you and Mr. Qi

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.210
were once good friends.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.730
Are you two like this now

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.490
due to the Raw Diamond Case?

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.280
We're simply colleagues now.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.970
I'm the police captain,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.360
and he's the forensic.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.170
Don't worry.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.800
It won't affect our work.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.730
I know.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.280
I'll fill out the case report now.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.280
The Raw Diamond Case is closed.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:17.890
Why are you still after it?

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:19.560
Han Feng,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.690
I've told you so many times.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:23.730
You think

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.360
Li Ming is the drug manufacturer.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.970
But Li Ming has suffered

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.080
from polio since childhood.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.080
He's limp in his left leg.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.490
But the person who got out of that car

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.970
at the scene

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.800
back then

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.280
wasn't limping at all!

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.410
So I can be certain

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.010
that it wasn't Li Ming at all!

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.800
You didn't

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.120
investigate Fei's death properly.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.360
Li Yiqi

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.690
and Jiang Fei

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:51.280
were the leads

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.280
on that case back then.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.890
So you came to He City

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.650
because of this?

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:57.930
Back then,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.850
only Li Ming's DNA

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:00.970
was found in my car.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.010
And you think you saw someone,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.080
but you were unconscious.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.320
Your intuition

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.560
and your memory

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.520
are both unreliable.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.280
Qi Sizhe,

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.760
you just simply can't

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.630
convince yourself.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.310
The Raw Diamond Case is closed.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.410
You just don't want to face the truth.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.690
Who is it?

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.730
Help me!

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.210
Miss?

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:51.520
Are you okay?

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.080
Here, sit down.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.210
Don't be afraid.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.520
It's very safe here.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.600
I've called the police.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:24.730
They'll be here soon.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.080
Just rest assured.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.170
How did you get injured?

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.250
Can you hear me?

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:35.560
See?

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.040
I told you the police would come.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:37.930
Just wait here.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.600
No!

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.650
No...

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:40.760
No...

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.360
Don't worry.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.970
It's fine.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:45.560
Officer?

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.170
You guys come quickly.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.250
My eyes!

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.730
Who are you?

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.600
Sorry, Mr. Bai.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.220
We didn't notice

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.280
Ms. Zhao's issue.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.600
It was my mistake.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.660
It's not your responsibility alone.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.120
None of us expected that.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.940
You still have work ahead of you.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.220
I hope you can

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.940
quickly adjust your mindset

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.330
and carry on.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.620
I understand.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.860
Oh, Mr. Bai.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.330
Mr. Han and Mr. Qi,

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.860
did something happen

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.810
between them before?

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.380
Their relationship always

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.220
seems odd to me.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.140
Come in.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.570
Mr. Bai, Ms. Zhu.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.180
New case.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.050
Mr. Han

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.010
and Mr. Qi are informed.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.330
I'll go now.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:02.900
Okay.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:15.840
Mr. Han.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:16.970
Sit rep?

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.650
The victim is Huang Hao,

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.010
owner of this pork shop.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.450
We received his emergency call

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.320
at 8:17 PM.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.280
In the call, he said

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.650
a girl ran into his house

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.170
and seemed very frightened.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.600
When we arrived

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.280
at 8:37 PM,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.210
he was already dead.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.450
No other leads yet.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.080
And the girl?

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.210
Didn't see her.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.760
The murderer probably used

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.560
pepper spray first.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.800
While losing his vision,

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.670
the victim took several

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.360
heavy blows to the head.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.040
After losing the ability to resist,

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.320
a bone was pierced
directly into his heart,

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.490
causing his death.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.930
This size...

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.520
Is it the girl

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.490
mentioned in the call?

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.860
Judging from the footprint size,

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.170
the person is around 160 cm,

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.300
likely a female.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.410
Here's a larger shoe print.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.450
These two bloody shoe prints are

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.530
not the victim's.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.340
Most likely left by the murderer.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.300
The shoe prints indicate

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.970
weight shifted backward,

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.340
pressed deep and evenly

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.580
into the ground.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.690
It suggests that

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:52.930
they may have carried someone else.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:55.380
Ms. Zhu,

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.820
when will you arrive?

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.300
The murderer

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.540
probably took the injured girl.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.820
We need backup.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.780
Expand search scope.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.010
Yes.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:07.890
Freeze! Stop there!

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.490
You stay here

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.490
and wait for Ms. Zhu.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:13.340
Han Feng?

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.170
Where?

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.300
Went that way.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.380
Careful. Wait for backup.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.890
Yes.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.700
Ms. Zhu.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.970
We received the call

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.850
at 8:17 PM.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:56.810
When we arrived

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.410
at 8:37 PM,

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.330
the victim was already dead.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.410
Also,

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:00.520
we spotted someone

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.370
suspicious on the hill.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.520
Mr. Han's after them.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.770
And Mr. Qi?

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:05.330
Mr. Qi

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.120
seems to go that way.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:04.600
Ms. Zhu!

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.080
Ms. Zhu,

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.600
we couldn't reach Mr. Han.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:11.240
Where's our backup?

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.160
About 15 minutes to arrive.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:15.720
Hey, look.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.450
There's a cave here.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.410
The kidnapped girl was

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:20.890
probably taken inside.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.560
Could Mr. Qi also go inside?

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:39.680
Su,

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.370
go that way.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.810
Okay.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:01.850
Ms. Zhu!

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.370
Found a glove.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:12.680
Probably left to us

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.520
by Mr. Qi.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.930
Come on.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:25.680
This way.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:28.080
Still running?

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.490
Huh?

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.330
You chased me, of course I ran!

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.160
Why did you commit murder, and how?

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.180
I didn't!

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.680
I'm not a murderer!

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.600
Stealing, too?

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.080
I... I just stole a few things.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.080
I didn't kill anyone!

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.520
I saw the murderer!

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.370
You mean the killer took someone

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.040
and left the shop?

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.040
To where?

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:10.240
I don't know that!

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.120
I really don't!

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.810
Be honest now!

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.810
No, I don't know!

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.640
I really don't!

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.010
I didn't kill anyone!

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.640
Watch him.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.560
Wait for me.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.720
Mr. Han.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:24.640
Where are they?

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.330
Mr. Qi likely went after the killer.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.680
Ms. Zhu and Su went to find him.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.600
Couldn't reach them.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.080
Where?

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.850
Over there.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:01.680
Ms. Zhu?

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.080
Ms. Zhu!

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.490
I've checked that side.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.850
All dead ends.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.930
Ms. Zhu!

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.010
Mr. Han.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:10.890
Where's Qi Sizhe?

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.240
No sign yet.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.370
That guy I just arrested said

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.370
the killer was in the shop.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:16.770
Qi Sizhe should be after them.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.720
Now we know that

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.560
the killer killed one

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.490
and likely kidnapped one.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:20.410
Don't know what

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.040
will happen.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.330
Time's running out.

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:22.890
We must hurry.

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.200
Both sides are dead ends.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:26.770
Let's go and see that way.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:27.240
Come on.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.330
Qi Sizhe,

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:44.730
you shouldn't...

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.320
Don't move.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.450
This is a funnel-web spider.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:01.720
Highly poisonous.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.970
An adult bitten

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.160
will die in 15 minutes.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.450
Don't go investigate

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.330
alone ever again.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.560
I didn't find the girl.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.720
However,

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:14.810
I found this.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.010
More to this side.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:46.290
Take it slow.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:52.520
Could every cocoon

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.450
have a person inside?

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:03.520
Just a doll.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:05.010
Mr. Gao?

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.370
Found anything?

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:07.640
All dolls.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:15.680
Something's inside.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.970
Gao Yuan?

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:35.040
What's that smell?

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.370
Mixed gas.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.810
Hydrochloric acid,

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:41.520
concentrated.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.720
Isn't this doll filled

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.410
with human remains?

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.720
No human.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.120
Should be animals.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.370
Probably cow's.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.120
Ms. Zhu.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.160
We had some new discoveries.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:02.600
We found a new

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.680
open area ahead.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:04.720
There are human cocoons.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.370
Not sure if any victims are involved.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.890
We need your backup.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.240
Just go straight

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.330
on this road,

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.330
and you'll find us.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:12.040
Hurry.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:18.290
Wan?

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:53.810
Be gentle.

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:04.140
Still a doll.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.890
Wan.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:14.640
Look.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.290
So much garbage.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.410
The suspect has been living here

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:25.160
for quite a while.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:29.540
Mr. Gao.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.220
Take this waste back

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:31.890
and run

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.890
a DNA test.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:33.620
Okay.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.770
Be careful!

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.240
That sound...

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.180
It's not a doll.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.330
It's a body.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:13.330
The killer might be mimicking
the funnel-web spider

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:14.100
to kill his prey.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.450
Those dolls were likely
his practice pieces.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:17.910
The kidnapped female is likely

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.410
still in the killer's hands.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.660
We must get her out

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.540
no matter what!

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.740
The organs inside the doll

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.490
were leaked from
their virus experiments.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.100
Do you suspect that
this is related to the school?

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.140
The killer's probably

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.930
among the students in the experiment.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.410
Ye Yingying has tiny pinhole
marks on her chin.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.700
Could it be from cosmetic surgery?

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:36.370
Why did you kill her?

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:37.100
And how?

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.580
Why would I kill someone?

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.140
He didn't paint all

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.260
his victims, did he?

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:43.290
I've seen her.
