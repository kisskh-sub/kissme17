[Episode 2]

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240
[Rong Residence]

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.039
This is mine.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:38.200
Mine.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.950
-Brother Zhang, please.
-This is mine.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.509
What brings

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.950
so many Young Masters here?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.000
It said that the Tea King, Rong Family,
seeks a husband for the daughter.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.680
Really?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.470
The Rong Family
is one of the wealthiest in the land.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.259
I wonder which Young Master will

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.509
have the honor of being chosen?

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.640
So many people here.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.190
What is this huge crowd doing here?

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.660
My Lord.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.570
The Rong family is choosing
a husband for Miss Rong.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.120
The whole Linji is buzzing about it.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.080
Many noble families

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.470
are rushing to the Rong family.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.150
My Lord, it'd be better not to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.870
trouble them

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.930
at a time like this.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.400
I shall see for myself

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.230
what manner of house this Rong family is,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.110
that so many are drawn to its gate.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.790
Go surround it.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.320
Yes.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.160
- Make way!
- Make way!

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.170
Make way!

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.520
Why are there so many officers?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.640
Make way! Step back!

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.760
What are you doing?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.280
We bear an invitation from

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.750
Magistrate Lu of Chunning County,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.750
humbly requesting the honor of
Lady Rong's presence.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:47.750
What is this about?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.400
What...What's happening here?

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.960
My Lord.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.060
Are we just going to wait like this?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.620
Yes.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.130
Until Lady Rong agrees to see us.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.710
His eyes are too small.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.300
This one's face is longer than a horse's.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.890
Next.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.060
A bulging brow and sunken eyes--so ugly.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.250
What in the world is this face!

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.360
Not good. None of these will do.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.680
They do not good indeed.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.400
Jingyi.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.050
Return all the birth charts and portraits.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.090
Send away those who came in person too.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.130
Just tell them.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.800
If they want our Rong family's

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.380
precious tea seeds next year,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.540
they should select

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.840
their finest clansman

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.910
and send them to our place for selection

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.700
before the spring tea harvest.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.579
Yes.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.590
Grandmother!

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.590
Grandmother!

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.460
Grandmother!

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.040
Why're you so panic?

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.290
Still so immature.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.510
Those people outside
are causing trouble again.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.790
I've tried repeatedly to persuade them,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.590
but they refused to move an inch.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.320
Check out this.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.310
Take a look.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.090
How insolent!

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.070
Madam Yang

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.750
clearly had her husband killed.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.510
What does that have to do with
the Rong family?

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.260
They demanded a witness for the court,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.140
and we already sent a steward to appear.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.000
We’ve shown them every courtesy.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.750
How dare they expect Grandmother to appear
in court herself!

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.460
I heard that

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.900
the newly appointed Magistrate Lu

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.700
seems to be

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.140
Minister Xu's
prized protégé from the capital.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.400
He's pretty arrogant.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.580
That Prefect Xu demanded double

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.750
the usual tribute from

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.410
our tea plantation last year,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.510
but Grandmother refused him outright.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.550
It seems this year

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.670
he wants to use this young magistrate

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.510
to test the Rong family's background.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.310
Prefects and Governors

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.020
come and go like revolving lanterns,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.430
yet our Rong family has stood firm
in Linji

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.290
for centuries.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.020
A mantis cannot block
the path of a mighty cart.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.990
With the county exams approaching,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.580
all we need is

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.670
to anonymously circulate
a few inflammatory posters

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.220
and encourage the students
to petition for a boycott,

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.880
which'd be enough
to make Governor Jiang yield.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.130
What do you think, Bao'er?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.870
I see three problems with this plan.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.900
First,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.870
the Rong family'd inevitably be suspected
of coercing the Governor,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.780
thus handing others
a ready-made accusation.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.630
Second, it'd delay the students from
taking the exams,

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.090
going against
Grandmother’s intention of supporting

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.950
poor students to benefit the community.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.700
Thirdly,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.310
in the eyes of ordinary citizens of Linji,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.900
the Rong family'd become
unscrupulous gentry

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.380
who incited examination boycotts

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.110
and disregarded law and order.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.310
Haven't we been supporting
those poor students

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.190
all along precisely for
such a critical time?

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.070
If we hesitate and waver now,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.950
won't Grandmother end up
being publicly questioned in court

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.550
under the gaze of thousands?

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.750
Don't forget that

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.900
the Wei family's tea plantation,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.780
though now entirely owned
by the Yang family,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.110
their ancient tea trees

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.200
are rooted in the Rong family garden.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.750
Who knows what the people of Linji

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.670
will say.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.870
Indeed.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.700
If you're really so capable,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.030
why don't you
come up with a good solution?

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.590
I certainly won't let him

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.760
act so recklessly in the Rong family.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.950
[Rong Residence]

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.460
We bear an invitation from

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.190
Magistrate Lu of Chunning County,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.190
humbly requesting the honor of
Lady Rong's presence.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.909
We respectfully request
the prescene of Lady Rong!

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.110
What's happening with the Rong family?

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.630
I heard they're harboring a runaway woman

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.070
and sheltering criminals.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.040
Who doesn's know Lady Rong's character?

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.070
Without any evidence,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.340
isn't this just nonsense?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.550
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.680
Complete nonsense!

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.460
My Lord.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.550
It's been three days already.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.780
The Rong family seems to be
carrying on as usual,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.580
no sign of any unusual activity.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.480
The whole Linji is talking about
this matter.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.070
I don't believe that Lady Rong

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.330
can remain so calm as if nothing happens.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.360
My Lord,
the Governor urgently summons you.

We demand to see Your Excellency!

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.340
Your Excellency!

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.510
We need to see Your Excellency!

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.430
With no referral,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.670
how can we sit for the exam?

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.110
Yes!

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.310
If I fail to achieve merit and fame,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.909
I shall forfeit my very life!

we're not leaving.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.140
Right, we're not leaving!

We must see Your Excellency!

Your Excellency!

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.750
Let us in!

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.510
Step back!

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.140
My Lord, something seems to have happened.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.820
I saw that.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.380
Use the back door.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:05.820
Yes.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.510
If you're investigating the case,
then you can just investigate.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.640
But who allowed you
to provoke the Rong family?

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.820
You've even made
Lady Rong ill with anger.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.480
Check this.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.310
This is a petition from the students.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.240
They're forcing the Your Excellency
to dismiss you.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.580
Anyone who incites students
to boycott the exams shall,

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.670
by law, face the sentence of death
by hanging with a reprieve.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.070
As an imperial official,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.950
how can you be controlled
by the Rong family?

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.740
Are they actually boycotting the exams?

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.620
No.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.030
The stipend scholars
of Linji,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.030
our of support and
indignation for Lady Rong,

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.950
have refused to provide guarantees.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.620
When the students heard of this,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.909
they gathered outside County Office,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.370
appealing to
Your Excellency to intervene.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.580
Let me ask you.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.670
Didn't the He family boast

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.700
that their Huqiu Tea of Mountain Wu
is the best in the world

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.740
and vow to surpass the Rong family?

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.910
How come Mr. He has stooped so low

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.040
as to come begging for their tea seeds?

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.060
When my family's Huqiu Tea

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.430
was renowed throughout the world,

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.870
Yangxian, Tianchi,

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.630
Beiyuan and Songluo

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.110
were content to be mere inferiors.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.700
The Rong family's Longjing tea

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.670
wasn't even known by anyone

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:09.270
back then.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.590
How come our Young Master
isn't good enough to marry her?

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.830
Events from just a decadee ago
are too shameful to recall,

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.910
and yet you dare trumpet achievements

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.630
from a hundred years back?

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.700
She is mine.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.630
Young Masters, you must
be weary from your journey.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.090
Please, take your rest
at Xinfang Pavilion.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.540
This courtyard has a beautiful view.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.350
Yes, indeed.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.670
Look over there.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.780
How exquisite. Look, Young Master.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.390
Guess who I am?

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.330
Cousin, stop fooling around.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.630
Bao'er, you must have eyes

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.260
in the back of your head.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.350
How many times have I told you

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.550
to call me Xiangling?

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.700
Weren't you studying at the academy?

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.740
Why did you suddenly come here?

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.670
Does Uncle know?

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.500
If I didn't come,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.020
[Wen Can]

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.390
and let someone arrange your marriage,

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:36.020
wouldn't I regret it

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.280
for the rest of my life?

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.390
I'm here to win.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.540
You won't win.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.020
You don't want

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.030
a childhood sweetheart,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.980
but you insist on choosing from
a bunch of strangers

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.440
with unknown intentions?

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.310
Bao'er, you're so confused.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.540
Miss Rong,

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.260
all Young Masters have all arrived
at the mansion.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.220
Are you really not going to take a look?

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.060
Silly girl.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.410
Xiangling already has me by her side.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.090
Years ago,

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.770
my aunt fled to the Wen family,

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.780
and she was grateful that
my father gave her some soup.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.270
They then became sworn siblings.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.590
When the Wen family declined later,

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.980
she'd often bring me

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.250
to play with you.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.000
We may be family by oath,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.740
but we're closer than most real family.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.330
You are my cousin
who was raised in luxury,

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.630
being so innocent and sincere.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.220
When've you ever experienced
harsh realities in life?

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.040
Once you've experienced

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.740
the fierce competition for victory,

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.630
then come and speak your heart to me.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.190
Then please await the good news,
Xiangling.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.510
Keep a close eye on him.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.440
I understand.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.040
Don't worry, Miss.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.190
They've sent dozens of troublemakers today

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.870
without a thought for

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.600
whether we can handle them all.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.470
Hey, the new one!

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.510
You need to hurry.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.440
If it rains tomorrow,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.980
this stench will spread for miles.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.780
By then, if it bothers those noble guests,

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.310
you'll be beaten with a rod.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:23.980
Move it! Move it!

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.670
You...You!

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.900
Get that out of my way!

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.350
You're really asking for a beating.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.540
The horses eat fresh grass

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.190
delivered from the meadows every day.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.250
Fresh horse dung should be greenish.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.910
Only these few horses have droppings

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:37.910
as hard as stones.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.830
These horses also look listless.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.910
We should find someone
who can treat sick horses.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.910
This is from being driven too hard
on the road

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.300
without feeding them enough water.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.230
What do you know?

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.150
Miss Rong is kind-hearted

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.320
to give you those few bowls of leftovers,

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.830
but don't think you're something special?

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.700
Mr. Wen brought

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.870
these prized horses from Northern Ji

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.460
are fed only the finest fodder.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.800
Who'd dare let anything happen to them?

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.150
If you dare talk nonsense again,

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.630
I'll report you to the steward.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:58.630
Then they'll pin you to the ground

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.350
and give you thirty lashes first.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.450
What are you waiting for?

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.530
Before sunset,

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.980
hurry and take those vats of

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.870
fermented manure

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:05.680
to the garden.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.260
Hurry up!

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.110
Dillydallying...

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:12.950
It's not worth arguing with

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.350
such a fool over nothing.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.500
I must find out from Miss Rong

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.870
about my background and identity.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.930
Then I can leave this wretched place.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.260
Brother Yang.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.070
The host hasn't invited us yet,

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.780
but we're sneaking into this garden.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.710
I'm afriad if this is appropriate.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.000
We're not animals that

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.190
they can keep us in Xinfang Pavilion,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.910
and only give us some water and grass.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.370
The Rong family never said

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.460
we couldn't stroll in their garden.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.940
Besides, with Brother Yang here today,

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:45.950
which one of those

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.340
arrogant servants would

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.200
dare to stop us?

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.010
Yes, yes, yes.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.430
We're just following

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.830
to broaden our horizons.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.590
When it comes to

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.350
who is most deserving of Miss Rong's hand,

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.540
Brother Yang is without a doubt the man.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.430
But I've heard the Rong family's

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.800
marriage traditions are different.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.580
They don't allow formal engagements
or wedding banquets.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.500
But if the marriage
doesn't work out later,

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.540
even a son-in-law
who has entered the Rong household

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.870
will be immediately
sent back to his family.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:17.780
The Rong family's search for a son-in-law

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.910
was an old story from thirty years ago.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.740
It's only natural that ordinary folk

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.950
wouldn't know the details.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.830
Yangs are a prominent family in Linji.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.360
Even if others are unaware,

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.850
how could Brother Yang possibly not know?

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.110
I was just about to ask Brother Yang.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.670
Is it real that
the Rong family is run by women?

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.250
Is it true that
women are superior to men?

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.910
In years past, when the couple fell out,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:38.630
did they truly set a precedent by

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.020
"removing the father
and keeping the offspring"?

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.830
And what exactly is this "Tea Bone"

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.500
that's been passed down
through the generations?

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.560
Has the Rong family's immense wealth

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.430
truly fallen on

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.740
Miss Rong's shoulders alone?

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.050
If you're fortunate enough to become
the Rong family's son-in-law,

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.510
you'll naturally know
what you need to know.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.470
I'm afraid you don't have such luck,

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.670
so why bother asking?

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.260
I'm just curious, that's all.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.350
Although we have some wealth,

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.820
compared to the Rong family,
it's like a drop in the ocean.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.830
But you, Brother Yang,
with your impressive wealth,

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.190
why do you also come
to join this excitement?

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.450
None of your business.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.430
Yes.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.520
Your criticism
is most enlightening, Brother Yang.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.240
You thieving beast!

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.590
What are you looking at?

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.390
Where did this filthy trash come from?

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.220
How dare he eavesdrop on our conversation!

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.750
I... I'll leave right away.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.540
I am an honored guest invited by
the Rong family.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.870
What is that murmuring!

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:31.870
You bastard!

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.440
Showing no respect at all!

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.290
Clean my shoe!

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:51.300
Young Master Wang, please don't be angry.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.110
I... I...

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.950
I'll clean them for you right away.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.490
Wang what?

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.980
No wonder he's carrying manure.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.220
It turns out he's half-deaf.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.020
Brother Wang,

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.740
don't bother arguing with a deaf guy.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.740
It'll be a disgrace to your dignity.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.100
Wang Lu, tell him to leave quickly.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.060
Wang Lu.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.280
Fine. I'll remember you.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.540
Get lost now!

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.980
Are you waiting for a slap?

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:15.060
Who?

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.480
Even before you beat a dog,
you should need to know who its master is.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.340
Our Rong family isn't a place
for you to make a scene.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.050
Miss Rong, please don't be angry.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.950
My friend here acted rashly

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.220
and offended you.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.890
Wang Lu,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.460
hurry up and apologize to Miss Rong.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.640
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.190
I heard everything

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.230
you just said.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.730
In the Rong family,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.790
if someone is looked down upon,

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.980
it's never because he is a man,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.870
but because he lacks intelligence,

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:05.110
has poor characters,

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.480
and fails to serve his family loyally.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.390
When a woman can manage the household
and pursue a career,

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.520
it's not simply because she is a woman,

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.630
but because she possesses
both virtue and talent,

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.290
earning everyone's respect.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.350
This talk of male superiority

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.670
or female superiority

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.190
is something I've never heard before.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.500
The Rong family has always disdained
such discussions.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.220
Allow me to ask our guests
to respect our traditions

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.300
and refrain from
such disrespectful remarks.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.740
We were all ignorant

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.060
and spoke arrogantly.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.590
It's all my fault.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.020
Knowing it was our first meeting,

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.630
I refrained from speaking bluntly

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.960
to avoid offending you.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.900
Please forgive my impropriety, Miss Rong.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.280
Mr. Wang has a hot temper

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.760
and has frightened you.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.360
Take this to calm yourself.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.090
Duplicitous and self-destructive.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.950
This kind of guy
is treacherous to the core.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.260
If Miss Rong marries him,

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.460
the Rong family line will come to an end.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.750
Thank you for your generosity,
Young Master.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.920
Alright, show them out.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:22.430
Miss Rong.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.020
It's all because of this wretched beast

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.460
who made me

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.060
lose face in front of Miss Rong!

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.990
-I...
-Mr. Wang.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.950
We're hosting a banquet today
at Xinfang Pavilion

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.460
for distinguished guests.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.660
If you don't go back now, you'll be late.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.800
All Young Masters,

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:01.870
please.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.250
Lovely as the peony in spring,

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.630
yet cold as the steel that scours bone.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.300
You stepped in with your feigned defense

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.300
after I'd already endured
all the scolding and blows.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:26.300
No way.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.230
I need to see you privately

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:29.960
to get a clear explanation.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:44.700
Miss, I think you're overthinking.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.230
He really did hurt his head.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.350
Otherwise, with his usual scheming nature,

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.010
how could he allow others
to bully him like this?

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.690
Time reveals a person's true nature.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.760
Did he stumble
into it by accident,

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.440
or deliberately sneak in?

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.010
We'll figure that out one day.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.640
If he has ulterior motives,

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.990
he'll suffer the consequences.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:10.320
Send him a bottle of medicine.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.320
Miss.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.500
Reviving Hall's "Corpse-Reviver Elixir"

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.949
costs a hundred taels per pill,

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.150
which is more than a decade of his wages!

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:19.380
You're certainly being generous.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.909
Then give him one pill only,

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:22.139
in case he dies

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.790
and wastes my two old ginseng roots.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.310
So many people are after
the Rong family fortune

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.570
and Miss Rong herself.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.429
Only if we two join forces
against our enemies

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:48.489
do we have
a slight chance of success.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.030
So you're saying

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.980
you want to form an alliance with me?

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.620
At tonight's the Rong family banquet,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.389
I shall first offer you
my pledge of loyalty

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:56.909
as the proof of my good sincerity.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.040
How does that sound?

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.330
Young Master,

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.620
hosting a banquet is one thing,

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.430
but why'd the Rong family

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.100
consider it necessary

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.460
to provide such beautiful companions?

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.040
The royal family, to avoid choosing
the wrong groom for the princess,

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.230
always sends palace maids to test
the groom before the wedding.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.360
The Rong family is a prestigious clan.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.900
They want to test their future son-in-law.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.270
I dare to guess,

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.140
if a Young Master is
fortunate enough to get chosen,

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.270
it may well depend on

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.090
whether the maid is willing to

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.820
put in a good word for him
before the hostess.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:35.830
Let's have another drink.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.350
With a beauty here to warm and serve wine,

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.310
even if I don't win Miss Rong's hand,

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.020
I can still count the evening well spent.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.860
This trial by wine and beauty will prove

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.430
who is clear-headed enough

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.430
for what comes next, the real tests.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.030
Let's apply a bit of pressure

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.750
and help wash away

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.410
a few unworthy grains of sand.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.950
This is excellent wine.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.270
Have some more, Young Master.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.470
Yes, yes, no problem.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.340
I really can't drink anymore.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.660
Mr. Wen.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.980
With the host's wine,

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.240
let me first propose a toast to you.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.140
Mr. Wen, why are you

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.800
drinking jasmine wine alone?

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.790
Young ladies may favor
its floral sweetness,

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.750
but it's a bit too mild for our tastes.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.460
Here, try this Autumn Dew White.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.800
Here, Brother Wang,

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.450
let me toast to you.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.060
Today, two friends of mine

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.990
accidentally offended Miss Rong.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.960
They feel deeply regretful

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.850
and I was hoping
you could help smooth things over.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:06.400
Here.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.480
Young Master, you worry too much.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.310
Mr. Wen.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.270
Your two families are so related.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.140
Since you'll be
visiting each other often in the future,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.540
I hope we may
call upon your kindness often.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.140
Mr. Wen, such small cups
are no way to enjoy a drink!

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:24.950
Let's switch to bigger cups.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:25.910
-Come on, Mr. Wen.
-No, no, thanks.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.370
Come on.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.280
Come.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:32.910
Here, come.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:33.500
-Let me fill your cup.
-Mr. Wen.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.300
Let's all have a drink together.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:37.580
We won't leave until we're drunk tonight.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.170
Brother Bai.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.230
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.790
Brother Bai, we've not finished yet.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:41.660
Exactly. I have a fine piece of

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.500
calligraphy at my place.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.180
Let's go to my place.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.180
-No, no.
-Let’s go.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:44.950
-Let's go.
-Come on.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:45.950
-Bottoms up.
-No need.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:46.500
Really, there's no need.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.540
Let's go, Brother Bai.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:47.910
Drink.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.570
Bottoms up.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.010
Bottoms up.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:50.640
Come on.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.500
Good tolerance.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.530
Here, let me fill your cup.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.870
Slow down.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.830
Don't rush. Let me close the door first.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:14.180
Who are you?

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.600
What are you doing?

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:21.840
Who is it?

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.620
You drive away and beat
your guests for no reason.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.720
How can you justify this?

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.390
-That’s right.
-Yeah.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.830
I want to speak to Miss Rong about this.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:36.140
Our Rong family meant to kindly host

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.140
guests from afar.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.640
But we don't treat lecherous scoundrels.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.710
We served you with good wine and meat,

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.370
but we've fed a bunch of swine!

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.790
How dare you get drunk
and harass our maids?

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.190
Have you lost your minds?

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.540
One more word out of any of you,

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.500
and you'll be tied up
and hauled to the County Office,

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.700
Let them have your backs beaten to pulp!

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.180
But...

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.420
Didn't your family mention
a trial marriage?

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.540
What trial?

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.740
Trial your fool head!

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.950
Have you been swilling so much wine

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.350
that your mouth spews filth?

00:38:59.350 --> 00:38:59.980
You're not fit to so much as hand me,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.100
a maid's slippers,

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.390
let alone aspire to

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:03.060
our Miss!

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:03.980
I...

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.660
You...

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.790
Get lost!

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:07.610
Leave quickly.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.330
How embarrassing.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.060
Go!

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:14.500
Pah!

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.460
Fourth Miss,

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.650
Miss Rong's courtyard

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:34.100
never allows unauthorized entry.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.460
While no one notices,

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.270
let's leave quickly.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.350
The new tea is about to harvest,

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.230
Rong Shanbao is holding a meeting
at Chongxi Hall.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.140
All attendants around her
were assigned to leave here.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.470
How could she pay attention to this place?

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.320
It's tricky as someone is guarding there.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.170
I want to see Miss Rong.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.020
Could it be that someone else

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.680
is also looking for Miss Rong?

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.140
Oh no!

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.110
I forgot to apply the honey.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.020
Rong Shanbao

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.790
really did hide you here.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.320
[Sixth Miss of the Rong family,
Rong Yunwan]

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.490
You know what to do?

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:50.830
Yes, yes, I understand.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:52.500
I won't let this stand in the way of
your important work, Young Master.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.980
But if others find out...

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.430
Even if all of my ten fingers

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.460
were put in finger crushers,

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.800
it'd be due to his own lust and folly,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.860
and he deserved it.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.230
To be a son-in-law of the Rong family,

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.270
one must first maintain proper conduct.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.270
Wen Can was drunk and misbehaved tonight,

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:20.430
how could Miss Rong still want him?

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.230
After all the commotion this evening,
I can't sleep at all.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.760
Let's go.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.100
Come to my room for some chess games.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.070
Please.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:42.910
This is terrible.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.860
Wanwan, what are you afraid of?

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.260
I'm your sister.

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.930
I won't bite you.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.020
Come here.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:56.970
Come here quickly.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.390
It's been a while.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:03.950
You idiot have finally

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.350
grown some brains.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.080
It's not as easy
to fool as you used to be.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.310
Fourth Sister is mean!

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.310
-Fourth Sister is so fierce.
-Stay still.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.180
Let me go!

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:12.710
Let go!

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:13.710
Why are you running?

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.830
You ill-fated scourge,
who doomed your own mother!

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.690
How many more people in my family
do you want to harm?

00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:00.340
[Tea Tax]

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:01.790
That Prefect Xu demanded

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:02.950
double the usual tribute

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.460
from our tea plantation last year.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:04.700
Tea tax was one of
the ancient government's

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.740
[Hand over the tea tax!]

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:06.100
most important sources of revenue.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.500
[Abuse of power? Shackle/Exile!]

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.620
The Ming Dynasty's tea tax

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.140
was administered on a regional basis.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.460
The Sichuan region implemented
the Official Tea System

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.740
to facilitate the tea-for-horses trade

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.270
with frontier tribes for horses.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:16.460
While Jiangnan region

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.020
adopted the merchant tea system.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.620
Under the Tea License System,

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.680
merchants paid
corresponding taxes

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.580
for selling tea for profits.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.830
Ming Dynasty's tea taxation system

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.580
was a product of political prioritization.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.500
Its primary design objective

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.910
was to consolidate border security

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.180
rather than to generate revenue.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.140
The paradox of low tax rates

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.000
coupled with strict control
ultimately led to depressed tax yields.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.500
Although the tea-for-horses trade

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.100
helped maintain frontier stability,

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.500
it failed to translate effectively

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.020
into a fiscal advantage.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.070
Instead, it created fertile ground

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.220
for smuggling and corruption.
