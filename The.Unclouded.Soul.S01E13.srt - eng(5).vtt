[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.729
[Episode 13]

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.950
This flower sea
has been the final resting place

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.350
for women of the Realm of Mist and Void
for thousands of years.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.200
You and I will eventually
become part of this soil.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.090
It's just a matter of sooner or later.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.300
Watering like this,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.150
when will I ever finish?

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.210
It's like a bottomless pit.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.470
Today is the day of the trial.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.630
Why are you still here watering flowers?

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.480
I didn't know.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.340
No one told me.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.980
How dare they defy
Immortal Lord's wishes?

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.870
Come with me.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.470
[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.040
What are all these?

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:57.960
What are these things?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.490
They don't even look tasty.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.400
How can anyone swallow these?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.240
Follow me.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.680
I can't eat these.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.670
So many ingredients.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.910
Could it be that Immortal Lord
is preparing a welcome feast for us?

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.640
These dishes are too ordinary.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.470
Not as exquisite
as what my family's cook prepares.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.280
Indeed.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.690
You young ladies from official families,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.700
fed with the finest delicacies
since childhood,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.120
yet all talk and no skill.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.030
I explained to everyone yesterday.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.470
The immortal realm protects women,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.720
but it's not a place
where you get something for nothing.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.590
Before you arrived,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.110
the women in the immortal realm

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.300
had all experienced abandonment

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.870
or suffered abuse in the human realm.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.670
Immortal Lord is kind-hearted,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.440
so she allowed them all to stay.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.530
They all managed households
to some extent in the past,

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.140
so they're quite skilled in cooking.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.040
The only difference is,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.280
they did it for unworthy men before,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.470
but now,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.580
they do it all for themselves.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.260
Today's trial is cooking.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.020
If you don't put in the effort,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.160
you won't have a chance to stay.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.510
But at home,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.480
our parents never taught us how to cook.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.440
That's right.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.510
Cooking?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.310
Isn't that what servants do?

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.750
Exactly.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.510
That's right.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.770
Then you'll have to fend for yourselves.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.700
If you really can't cook,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.810
you can give up now.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.400
We're doomed.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.740
This has just begun,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.030
and you're out.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.750
What's wrong with you?

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.070
Don't get discouraged before I even start.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.130
It's true, though.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.240
You only know how to eat,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.920
not how to cook.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.720
You talk too much.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.190
We'll find out

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.409
once I try.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.870
I mean everyone should do their best.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.400
If you don't know how,
you'll learn by trying.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.390
Easier said than done.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.010
Exactly.

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:57.250
What if

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.550
we fail to pass the trial?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.060
What happens then?

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.630
If you fail,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.670
you'll find out naturally.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720
Now, I'll announce the trial rules.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.630
First,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.960
everyone must announce
the dish they want to make.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.270
Once a dish is claimed,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.120
others can't repeat it.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.550
Second, as you can all see,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.720
all ingredients are already on the table.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.160
Those who announce their dishes first
get to choose first.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.620
First come, first served.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.130
When the measuring scale fully rises,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.920
those who haven't completed their dishes

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.720
or have failed during the process

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.050
will all be eliminated.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.070
Dishes completed within the time limit

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.370
will be judged by Linghua Palace.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.210
Now announce your dishes.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.350
One dish per person,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.680
no repetitions allowed.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.610
-I'll make flower pastry.
-I'll make flower pastry.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.340
Dali, it's really delicious.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.780
It smells wonderful.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.630
This is Xiao Yao's flower pastry

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.820
made with withered petals.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.270
How does it taste?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.120
Delicious.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.750
Tasty.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.120
Ms. Fairy,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.190
I said it first

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.480
just now.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.360
I heard you.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.000
You said it first.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.000
Go get your ingredients.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.510
Okay.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.270
Ms. Fairy,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.480
I need osmanthus sugar, black sesame,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.810
and some flower petals.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.360
Take them yourself.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.960
Thank you.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.630
Next.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.700
I want to make Egg Custard.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.930
I want to make Scrambled Eggs with Shrimp.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.120
I'm sorry. I accidentally spilled the egg.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.240
Please forgive me.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.400
Go away.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.010
I want to make
Braised Chicken with Bamboo Shoots.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.570
That's enough.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.170
If you leave others with no way out,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.630
you're also heading
toward your own destruction.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.240
Go away.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.200
Yes.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.120
I was the first
to claim the Sweet and Sour Carp.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.870
Everything is mine!

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.800
Can't you let me have this for once?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.310
What are you doing?

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.310
Our fathers have the same official rank.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.190
Why should I give it to you?

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.390
I got to choose first!

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.040
You're being unreasonable!

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.840
Ms. Fairy, can I make fried rice?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.120
Pei, I want to make stir-fried cabbage.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.750
Vinegar cabbage.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.920
You've killed this fish!

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.160
You were the one
who pressed too hard first!

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.480
This is my cabbage!

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.310
This is mine! Give it to me!

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.430
I got it first!

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.810
Give me back my cabbage!

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.850
Everyone, go to your assigned stoves.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.720
If you use the wrong stove,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.990
the credit will go to someone else.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.760
You, have you decided what to make?

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.270
I...

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.390
Topping Noodles. Topping Noodles.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.920
I don't know how to make it.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.360
I do.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.890
Hurry up and say it,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.280
or we'll be eliminated.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.360
I'll make Topping Noodles.

Eel.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.560
I need eel.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.070
Fresh shrimp.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.070
Fresh shrimp.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.160
And flour.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.180
And flour.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.310
You're lucky.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.600
We have all the ingredients you asked for.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.420
Good, good.

and I'll give you a gold bracelet later.

You know, without ginger,

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.030
it just won't have the right flavor.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.000
Meat tastes better. I'll make a meat dish.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.260
Should I stir-fry everything together?

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.010
Don't blame me.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.670
Don't blame me.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.360
You...

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.010
A bunch of useless people.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.840
Get out of here, all of you!

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.910

What are you doing?

If you dare ruin my dish,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.330
I'll never forgive you.

-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.530
I will definitely win.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.600
I must stay here.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.750
So,

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.440
you're willing
to throw away our friendship?

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.480
You say we're friends,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.030
but we have never

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.360
been treated as equals.

After you came to Demons' Valley,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.240
in just a few days,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.320
you made all the minor demons adore you.

supreme among all flowers,

You call me and Luoluo your friends,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.720
only because we're not as clever as you,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.920
not as cunning as you.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.930
Does our existence

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.790
serve only to satisfy
your sense of superiority?

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.600
Why?

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.750
Why do humans and demons pamper you?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.410
Why can everyone only see you?

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.440
We're not friends anymore.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.480
Immortal Lord only likes flowers
without green leaves.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.270
So do I.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.750
No one is willing to be just a leaf.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.400
Xiao Yao,

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.430
no time for sentimentality now.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.480
I have Hong Ye's memories
of learning to make Topping Noodles.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.740
Open your eyes wide and watch carefully.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.320
Are you ready?

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.080
I'm ready. What's next?

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.280
Slice the eel.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.360
The eel.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.320
How do I cut it?

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.540
Hold down the head.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.920
Put it on the cutting board.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.000
Use the knife

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:13.750
to split its body.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.390
Like this.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.100
Use a smaller one.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.440
And then?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.670
Slice it up.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.080
Good. That's enough.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.630
Heat the wok and add oil.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.960
Heat the wok and add oil.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.510
Oil.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.800
Coat the eel in batter.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.500
What does that mean?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.810
It means putting the eel

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.030
into the batter.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.790
Eel.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.270
Batter.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.640
Add some batter.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.480
Add some water.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.400
Too much water. Add more batter.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.550
If you don't add the eel soon,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.550
the wok will burn.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.250
Right away. Right away.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.480
Fry the eel
until the batter forms a crust.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.540
Crust? What does that mean?

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.830
It means it gets hard.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.170
When it hardens, that's the crust.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.240
It's hardened now.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.910
What next?

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:44.750
Take it out.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.440
It actually looks pretty good.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.200
Are the side ingredients ready?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.000
Shrimp.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.440
Only shrimp?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.910
No green onions?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.160
Put in the eel and shrimp.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.230
When do I add this ginger?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.440
Did you forget?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.060
Well...

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.150
It's up to you.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.240
Then I will

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.320
add 2 pieces.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.430
Is the sauce ready?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.530
Coming right up.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.550
Sauce.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.700
Who are you talking to?

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.150
Soy sauce, cooking wine.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.850
Two spoonfuls.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.630
Sugar.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.600
Pepper.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.080
Salt.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.360
The wok is about to burn.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.890
Don't rush me. Coming right away.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.550
Water.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.250
Don't add water! It will splatter!

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.450
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.080
What should we do, Little Leaf?

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.080
Even if Hong Ye were here,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.830
he couldn't help now.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.630
I have an idea.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.870
What idea?

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.920
I'll make them

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.790
something different.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.270
Here's a bracelet.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.130
Please, let's switch our dishes.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:12.720
Time's up.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.560
My hands are burning red!

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.589
Stop now.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.550
Such humble food.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.170
I can't believe you came up with this.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.510
Immortal masters

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.160
are used to all kinds of delicacies.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.490
But ordinary people
often have only a bowl of plain noodles.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.070
Immortal Lord has great compassion

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.160
and created the Realm of Mist and Void
for suffering women.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.030
Surely she's always cherished a heart
that stands for equality for all,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.610
frugality in governance,
and love for the people.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.720
And this bowl of noodles

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.200
is exactly what you would find

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.730
on every commoner's table.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.680
Sharp-tongued.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.400
Let's see if that silver tongue of yours

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.200
can really save your life.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.090
[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.110
The tasting results are out.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.650
Those whose dishes are called,

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.030
please step forward.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.370
Flower pastry.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.310
Cherry Pork.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.400
[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.730
Golden Jade Abundance.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.970
Flower-Cut Mandarin Fish.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.260
Phoenix-Tail Shrimp.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.500
Lotus Pod-Shaped Tofu.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.270
[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.160
Guinea Fowl.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.250
Stewed Chicken with Bird-Shaped Dumplings.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.370
Shark's Fin with Scrambled Egg Yolk.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.540
Yangchun Noodles.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.180
All of you,

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:01.400
[Harmony of the Five Flavors]

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.000
follow me to Linghua Palace.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.750
Ms. Fairy,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.510
please give me one more chance.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.350
Ms. Fairy,

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.160
I made Sweet and Sour Carp.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.110
Ms. Fairy, please take me in.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.830
I would die for Dreamshard Immortal.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.830
Are you that desperate
to stay in the Realm of Mist and Void?

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.490
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.640
But the Realm of Mist and Void
never keeps idle people.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.310
Since you're so eager to stay,

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.150
I'll grant you the fate
of becoming flowers.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.220
Flowers?

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.240
Women

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.250
are meant to be cherished like flowers.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.360
Among today's dishes,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.640
the Yangchun Noodles
stand out as the best.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.750
Who made them?

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.970
Who made the Yangchun Noodles?

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.400
Step forward to answer.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.550
Immortal Lord, I made them.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.990
Where did you learn

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.900
to make noodles like this?

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.900
More than 10 years ago,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.480
my father suddenly fell very ill.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.920
He was bedridden for days.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.270
So I tried to cook like he usually did

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.750
and made a bowl of noodles.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.340
He said wild green onions
enhance the flavor,

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.550
so I sprinkled some in the noodles.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.880
After he finished eating,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.410
he was already much better.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.920
Years later, he would still say

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.130
it was the best thing he had ever eaten,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.400
because it was filled with sincerity.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.240
Today,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.640
I bring the same sincerity
as I did back then

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.790
to make this bowl of noodles for you.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.260
Not only are your noodles excellent,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.380
but you also tell a good story.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.040
No wonder Hong Ye

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.160
cherishes you so much.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.170
Then who made these flower pastries?

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.920
Immortal Lord, I made them.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.750
Flower Demon,

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.110
I didn't expect you to have real skills.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.640
You weren't exaggerating.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.310
Thank you for your recognition.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.640
With your talents,

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.000
you may continue to stay
in the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.350
However,

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.080
if you wish to cultivate
the art of eternal youth,

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.200
you must undergo the next trial.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.310
Zhirui,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.430
take them downstairs first.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.110
For the next trial,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.950
you can devise something interesting.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.330
Yes, Immortal Lord.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.620
This Heart-Devouring Poison

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.810
was refined
by Immortal Lord over 100 years.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.420
Be it humans or demons,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.400
within 7 days of being poisoned,

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.200
all will lose their minds
and become like puppets.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.860
But you've endured it for a month.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.690
That's truly unprecedented.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.540
What's wrong with being a puppet?

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.000
No heart,

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.110
no pain.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.550
Fighting against Immortal Lord

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.790
won't change the final outcome anyway.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.980
I once gathered all the fragments
of the Kunlun Mirror,

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.400
but I gave them to humans,

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.650
causing demons to be slaughtered

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.200
and bringing calamity for centuries.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.160
I deserve this torment.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.400
But if you want me to abandon my mind

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.270
and live without emotions or love,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.830
even if I'm shattered to pieces,

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.000
I will never submit.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.630
You've lived in this world
for thousands of years.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.070
You should know
how fickle humans are

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.270
and how unpredictable human nature is.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.510
Only by letting go of desires

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.480
and focusing on cultivation
can you achieve true enlightenment.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.310
Yet you keep giving your
devoted heart to humans.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.710
Haven't you been betrayed enough already?

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.240
If it's true love,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.400
it's worth starting over.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.920
I can see

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.880
you truly care for Xiao Yao.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.300
But in this Realm of Mist and Void,

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.830
you must do some things
for Immortal Lord,

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.950
so that Xiao Yao can have an easier time.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.830
What do you want me to do?

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.520
Immortal Lord's demonic power

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.160
requires large amounts of human essence.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.960
You can help Immortal Lord

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.960
by bringing more mortal women here.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.940
She would be pleased then.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.200
I promised Xiao Yao

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.640
I wouldn't harm innocent people.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.880
Then do you know

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.060
what humans are thinking,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.610
who are desperately seeking
the celestial mountain

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.640
on the ships in this sea?

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.490
Find the celestial mountain,

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.080
drink from the Yuli Spring,

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.120
and finally kill you
and your demon people.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.970
Their hearts have been consumed by greed.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.030
You can just let them
fulfill their dreams here.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.560
And what's wrong with that?

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.310
You don't know, do you?

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.920
The ones who led these people
into the Realm of Mist and Void

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.070
were themselves.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.920
The reason Immortal Lord sets up

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.680
trials in the Realm of Mist and Void

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.920
is to give these humans

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.180
a chance for survival.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.000
She hopes they can understand
the preciousness of life

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.060
and no longer be controlled by greed.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.160
Unfortunately,

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.750
they all chose to stay.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.510
I won't force you.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.850
If you change your mind,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.770
I'll open this dungeon barrier

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.750
and let you out.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.080
So you can see those

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.270
who are controlled by greed.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.000
But if they insist on coming here,

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.110
I ask you

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.170
to guide them a little.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.040
What's wrong?

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.870
I'm freezing.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.540
I'm freezing to death.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.420
The sun is so bright right now.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.750
How can you be cold?

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.690
I don't know.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.780
I just feel cold.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.270
Could Hong Ye be suffering
from extreme cold right now?

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.440
How would I know?

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.910
Come here.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.830
Let me warm you up.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.510
How's that?

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.720
For plants,

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.110
as long as their roots are healthy,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.160
they will be fine.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.490
You know quite a lot.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.480
Dali told me this before.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.720
May the heavens take pity on us

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.910
and guide us
to find the celestial mountain!

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.590
The heavens take pity on you?

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.440
Your desires
will only harm you in the end.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.240
Get out of here now.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.880
Steady your minds!

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.720
This is test

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.830
from the immortal!

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.030
Northeast position!

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.640
We offer our sincerity to the vast sea!

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.350
Immortal, please

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.940
show us the direction!

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.350
The celestial mountain
is not meant for mortal eyes.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.480
Our fellow disciple

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.610
gave her life to help us on our journey.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.370
We can't let her life be in vain.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.960
For immortality,

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.480
you would actually
sacrifice your companion.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.620
We beg you to show us the way!

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.060
If you drink from the Yuli Spring,

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.860
you will no longer have emotions

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.560
and no longer have a true heart.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.270
Do you still want that?

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.110
We offer our blood to the vast sea!

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.550
We beg you to guide us to Penglang!

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.200
If only one person

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.550
can survive to follow me
to the celestial mountain,

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:57.770
do you still want that?

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.720
Your greed is bottomless.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.220
Stop it, all of you!

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.490
Today, I will grant your wish.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.000
Why are you always so fresh and dewy

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.600
without being watered?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.270
Where did you get the dew?

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.280
This must be the celestial mountain.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.880
Celestial mountain.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.320
Yuli Spring.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.230
Where is the Yuli Spring?

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.200
Thank you, Exalted Immortal,
for your favor.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.550
To reach the celestial mountain
in this lifetime,

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.320
any suffering is worth it.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.010
You must be an immortal.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.030
But looking at you,

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.190
you don't seem much different
from us mortals.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.480
Do not be disrespectful
to the immortal maiden.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.080
Yes.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.420
May I ask, where is the Yuli Spring?

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.160
After you drink from the Yuli Spring,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.590
you will no longer have feelings

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.680
or a true heart.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.160
Do you still want that?

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.790
Why are you saying the same things
as the immortal we met earlier?

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.270
For the sake of immortality,

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.600
everything in the world can be abandoned.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.440
Yes.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.830
We hope you will help us.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.320
Which immortal did you just mention?

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.360
He wore red and white robes,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.940
handsome and elegant,

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.560
clearly someone from an immortal sect.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.240
Did he bring you here?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.450
Yes, indeed.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.650
Sect Leader.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.250
Look at her attire.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.000
She's just a servant at most.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.490
It's pointless to ask her.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.800
The true immortals are coming!

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:15.920
They are indeed immortals.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.050
They are immortals.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:17.900
Immortals!

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.460
-Immortals!
-Immortals!

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.790
Welcome everyone
to the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.440
Is this Realm of Mist and Void
the same as Penglang?

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.970
So you are immortal ladies?

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.450
We are merely disciples
of Dreamshard Immortal.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.440
If you are fated to stay,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.280
we shall all address
each other as sisters.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:36.160
Sisters.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.310
Follow me.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.720
-Great.
-Let's go.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.120
Hurry.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.440
Go.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:40.750
Go.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:41.720
Go. Go.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.600
Let's go.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.310
This situation

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.610
repeats in the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.590
This place was once just
a small flower bed.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.160
But now,

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.290
it has transformed into a vast flower sea.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.610
And within the roots of each flower

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.200
lies buried the desires of each person.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.320
Generation after generation,

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.280
they come one after another.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.750
You want to stop it,

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.680
but are you capable?

[Lovely and intelligent]

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.030
Xiao Yao performed excellently

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.590
in her first trial.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.790
Immortal Lord
is quite impressed with her.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.400
If you stop being stubborn,

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.910
she won't need to participate
in the second trial.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.590
She can accompany Immortal Lord

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.350
and share immortality with her.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.750
This second trial

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.170
is different from the previous one

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.840
and much more dangerous.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.590
I know.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.469
You refuse to let the poison
control your mind

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.320
because you still care for Xiao Yao.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.199
But if you insist on
defying Immortal Lord,

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.260
causing her
to take her anger out on Xiao Yao,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.730
wouldn't that go against
your true intentions?

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.760
Don't you want

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.190
to protect the one you love?

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.590
Right now, you can move freely,

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.040
only because Immortal Lord
hasn't activated the poison.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.630
The agony of the poison

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.590
is something
you've already experienced deeply.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:39.989
Why not join with Xiao Yao

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.630
and willingly become part
of my Realm of Mist and Void?

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.480
Let me go back.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.110
Hong Ye is truly stubborn.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.150
And Xiao Yao has such a sharp tongue.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.690
If they really stay
by Immortal Lord's side,

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.640
it will be trouble for everyone.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.800
We might as well
take advantage of the trial

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.200
and get rid of them early.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.130
You're telling me all this

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.320
because you want me
to report to Immortal Lord?

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.250
I wouldn't dare.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.400
But seeing how ambitious Xiao Yao is,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.510
aren't you afraid that if she stays,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.560
she'll usurp your position?

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.320
Pei.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.550
Your tone now

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.950
is becoming
more and more like Ying Ning's.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.000
Please don't talk nonsense.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.550
What I just said

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.830
was for everyone's benefit.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.680
It was for yourself.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.920
That's the truth.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.550
Congratulations to you.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.840
What is there to congratulate?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.510
You've worked so hard
for the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.440
and your loyalty
to Immortal Lord is evident.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.920
Immortal Lord is considerate

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.780
and ordered me
to give this immortal dew balm to you.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.490
Apply it day and night,

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.920
and the scars on your face will disappear.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.000
Then

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.880
I must thank you, Zhirui.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.770
With Immortal Lord's immortal dew,

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.100
your beauty will surpass what it once was.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.580
I will thank

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.110
Immortal Lord in person.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.070
Immortal Lord
is protecting her so much.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.130
Won't she walk all over us from now on?

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:47.970
We'll see about that.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.740
Are you angry with Hong Ye?

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.380
He didn't talk to you today

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.100
because Dreamshard's confidant
was right beside him.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.710
He did this

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.070
to protect you.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.150
Can you sense

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.090
what Hong Ye is doing right now?

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.760
I don't know.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.840
Then what can you do?

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.960
I can summon Hong Ye's true self

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.420
to be with you for a moment.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.110
Don't believe me?

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.450
But my spiritual power
can only sustain it briefly.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.480
His true form can't come here.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.940
Only his primordial spirit
can be summoned.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.360
Then cast your spell.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.690
Cast it now. Cast it now.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.630
Watch carefully.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.150
Xiao Yao.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.550
Hong Ye.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.380
I've disappointed you.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.580
This is my primordial spirit.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800
Do you blame me?

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.010
What would I blame you for?

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.990
Should I blame you

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.180
for leading humans to this island

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.510
or blame you

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.140
for looking so haggard

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.710
for suffering the pain
of Heart-Devouring Poison alone?

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.840
The poison hasn't been activated yet,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.420
so I'm fine for now.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.320
I didn't speak to you during the day,

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.980
but that wasn't my intention.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.570
If I show you any extra attention,

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.940
it gives them reason to cause trouble.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.010
I don't want you to be harmed in any way.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.630
Dreamshard Immortal

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.280
keeps claiming
that human nature is greedy.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.610
I went to the sea

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.840
to stop humans from coming to the island.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.970
But their obsession with immortality

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.530
made them stubborn.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.790
I couldn't change anything.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.240
I understand.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.920
I understand you have many constraints.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.300
You've been through a lot.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.290
You spend your days

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.860
watering flowers in this flower sea,

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.590
working hard and getting tired.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.360
Though I can't always be with you,

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.890
at least Little Leaf is here

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.430
to take care of you for me,

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.200
which gives me peace of mind.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.660
Stretch out your hand.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.510
The second trial

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.060
is extremely dangerous.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.550
If you participate,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.410
you must be careful at every step.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:54.360
Hong Ye.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.760
Hong Ye!
