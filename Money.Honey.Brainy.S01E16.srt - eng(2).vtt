WEBVTT

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840
I really didn't expect that.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:45.600
I thought

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.799
you had given up painting long ago.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.399
Even though I went to business school later,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.079
I never really put down the brush.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.000
What about you?

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:54.520
Do you still paint?

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.399
I...

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.240
I stopped painting ages ago.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.560
Right after high school, I was in a hurry to find a job.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.560
Actually, when it comes to painting,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.159
you were always much more talented than me.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.439
I think it's never too late

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.920
to pick up the brush again.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.079
I propose

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.480
to provide all your paints and canvases,

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.719
and also offer a free

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:14.400
studio.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.480
No need.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.239
I'm not as good as you say.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.439
It's not free.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.519
This is an investment.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:22.079
Let me tell you,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.599
my investment instincts are always spot on.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.079
What a coincidence, you two.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:31.840
What are you doing here?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.040
A friend said there's a new small art exhibition here,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.879
so I came to take a look.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.719
Occasionally,

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.079
to cultivate myself a bit.

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:41.319
So,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.640
Lin Xiang

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.480
is the only son of the Lin Group.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.359
Graduated from

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.599
McKenburg University, Germany.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.799
McKenburg?

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.040
What kind of diploma mill is that?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.480
It is

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.040
a business school ranked in the global top thirty.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.280
Based on the information we have so far,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.879
his romantic history is very extensive.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.000
How so?

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.879
Publicly acknowledged ones

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.239
number as many as sixteen.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.000
Player.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.640
What about the unpublicized ones?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.280
From some indirect channels, we understand

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.319
the non-public ones

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.960
are no fewer than twenty.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.840
A lamb walking into a wolf's den.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
Good thing this tiger is here to protect her.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.960
This portrait is of you?

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.120
I didn't expect Brother Lin to be an artist too.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.319
My apologies, my apologies.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.840
I wouldn't dare call myself an artist.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.319
It's just a small hobby.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.800
You're being modest.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:33.560
Well then,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.120
let me show you around.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.879
Alright.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.479
What are you doing?

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.400
There's a special situation now.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.479
I just got word

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.159
that my dad's love agents are on the move again.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.840
So activities like yours,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.919
a solo date, are very dangerous.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.840
I have to say,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960
are these people ever going to stop?

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.360
Where are they?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.199
I don't see anyone.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.840
They're using high-tech this time.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.639
It's all cameras.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.680
Hold hands,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.000
quadruple pay.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.159
Deal.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.080
Thank you.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.280
This cat...

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.159
it's the one you had when we were in school, right?

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.439
Yes.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.520
It was with me from elementary school through university graduation.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.000
I thought it looked familiar.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.400
Where is it now?

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.479
Where?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.599
It's now...

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.800
It

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.280
went to the Rainbow Bridge eight years ago.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:09.599
You poor thing.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.199
That's so sad.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.840
It...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.959
Pets,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.600
they give their whole lives to us.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.839
I think your paintings now

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.720
are quite different from back in school.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.879
You mean from high school?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.680
Your paintings back then

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.279
were

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.680
more on the realistic side.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.000
But these paintings now

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.680
have a bit of a

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.120
Post-Impressionism feel to them.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.639
The colors are different too.

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.319
You don't remember who this painting is of?

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:01.040
You managed to paint like this in two months?

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.439
You're pretty good.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.240
I pick things up relatively quickly.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.600
Not modest at all.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.519
Well, look for yourself.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.199
I'm not bragging.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.879
Happy birthday.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.399
How did you know

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.759
today is my birthday?

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.439
I saw it on the registration list.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120
Thank you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.399
There's one more thing I'd like to ask of you.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.519
Could you be my model?

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:45.600
I...

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.199
I remember you only modeled for me once.

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:05.920
Back then,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.519
the art class fees were too high for me.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.319
So I planned

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.360
to start

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.240
working earlier

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:13.519
and gave it up.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.079
Why didn't you tell me?

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:16.920
I would have definitely helped you.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.639
How much is this painting?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.759
My paintings aren't worth much.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.600
What's precious is the youth that has passed.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.319
It's been many years

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.600
since I immersed myself in painting.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.839
These are just for fun.

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:52.000
I've always believed

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.279
that true artistic works

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.120
come from life experiences.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.600
I believe over all these years,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.879
you must have experienced a lot.

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:00.560
Let it settle,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.319
and you'll surely create good work.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.439
Actually, you're quite good at reading people.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.319
I also think he's emotionally... experienced.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.519
Been through a lot.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.360
Senior,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.120
I'll always support you.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.519
This painting

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.800
has fresh colors

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.079
and a simple composition.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.120
But I always feel that beneath this surface,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.319
there's something

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.480
hidden.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160
You understand me.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.839
Maybe it's because of my personality,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.560
I always like

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.040
to hide my truest feelings

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.319
beneath the surface.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.040
Kind people are all like this.

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:08.399
Willing to hide their true selves,

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.800
so as not to disturb others.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.319
Are you also that kind of person,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.639
Xin Tong?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.480
For so many years,

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.759
you're the only one who truly supported me in art.

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:23.079
As for my parents,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.439
they only want me to be

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.240
a puppet to inherit the family business.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:28.279
I believe in you.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.519
Whether in art

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.519
or in business,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.879
you will definitely succeed.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:39.440
Xin Tong,

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.919
I support you too.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.039
Friends

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.399
should support their friends' friends.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:53.519
Keep it up.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.960
By the way, Xin Tong,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.120
about what I mentioned last time,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.200
our company's collaboration with Four Seas Group,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.000
how is it going?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.080
In the list of new products for this Four Seas collaboration,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.600
your Lin Group desserts are included.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.480
Ranked third.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.600
You can rest assured about that.

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:10.120
That puts my mind at ease.

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:12.519
Four Seas is my most important client.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.600
But Four Seas is currently

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.399
on a downward trend.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.279
But in my view, Four Seas

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.120
is still a company with potential.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.360
Brother Lin, what are

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.759
your insights on Four Seas?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.120
Four Seas has a very good reputation in our industry.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.240
Although it's an old-established enterprise,

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.519
in recent years,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.240
it has consistently sought innovation.

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:36.480
This shift from physical to online

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.320
has been quite successful.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.639
Although in art,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.159
you're too technical,

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:43.799
but in terms of business acumen,

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.200
you are commendable.

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:49.559
But this new CEO who just took over,

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.879
is really hard to figure out.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:53.480
How so?

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.600
This person's working style is too aggressive.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:58.200
It's a double-edged sword.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:09:59.759
The risk is also very high.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.759
I think your analysis makes a lot of sense.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:03.480
Right?

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.519
By the way, Xin Tong,

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.919
if you're unhappy at Four Seas,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.639
you're welcome to join the Lin Group anytime.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:10.799
Not at all.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.879
I'm currently very happy

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:13.960
with my work at Four Seas.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.759
I haven't considered leaving yet.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.639
I think it's about time.

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:21.960
Maybe I should head back first.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.480
I wish your exhibition all the best.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:24.279
I'll see you out.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.279
No need.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:26.279
No need.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.480
We're going the same way.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:28.399
We live together.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:31.600
We share an apartment.

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:36.720
Actually, I don't want to go back now.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:39.399
How about we have a meal together?

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:40.399
Sure.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.639
I'm hungry anyway.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.759
What should we eat?

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:46.240
I want a date for just the two of us.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.759
I don't want a third person.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:49.840
Okay.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:51.919
Well then,

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.360
enjoy your meal.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.759
Right now, Xin Tong has no idea

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.120
that Lin Xiang is a complete scumbag.

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.240
But what you heard is just one side of the story.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:31.720
Continental Investigations couldn't be wrong.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:33.360
My investigation is very objective.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.639
Devoid of any emotional factors.

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:36.440
But...

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.720
No matter how many romantic experiences

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.879
this man had before,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.960
as long as he's sincere this time,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.240
we can't fault him.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.080
Then how can you be sure

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.519
that he's sincere this time?

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.320
Do we have to wait until Xin Tong gets hurt

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.399
for you to get your answer?

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.879
If you like her so much,

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:51.120
why did you go to such lengths to help her confess?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.480
That day was an accident.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.879
Don't laugh.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.399
Go ahead, laugh.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.639
You're back.

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:19.279
You...

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:22.279
What's wrong with you?

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.000
Why didn't you turn the lights on again?

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:26.399
Tonight, you guys...

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:28.360
only had one meal, right?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.519
Wen Pei'an.

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:32.639
No.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.159
You're really strange.

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:35.600
What exactly do you want?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.440
One day you tell me to be brave,

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:39.120
the next day you come to harass me.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.159
What do you mean?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.399
Is this the fun you rich people have?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.399
Do you really know your senior that well?

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.039
At least better than you do.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:47.360
But is it possible...

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.200
that he's not as good as you think he is?

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.080
I really need to remind you...

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.559
Our relationship is purely...

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:56.919
a business partnership.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.240
According to the contract terms,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.360
we have no right to interfere with each other's privacy

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.559
or personal lives.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.559
Well, according to the contract,

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:06.960
you're also not allowed to date during the partnership.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.360
I'm not dating anyone!

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.240
How is that not dating?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.159
What was the movie theater then?

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:11.480
You rented out the theater!

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:12.559
I rented the movie screening.

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:14.159
Wasn't the banner your idea too?

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:14.919
And...

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.559
those flowers...

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.039
that were suddenly delivered to me...

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:18.519
was that also your arrangement?

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:19.000
I...

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.519
I did send...

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:20.320
And also...

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.600
The night before, you told me right to my face...

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.440
to be brave and express...

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.639
my feelings for the other person.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.840
I expressed them!

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.039
What are you implying?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.240
Are you some kind of pervert?

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:37.000
Me, a pervert?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.039
Pervert.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.799
Xin Tong.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.159
The Lin Group really needs you.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:58.799
So do I.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.080
Senior.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.600
I was a bit impulsive before.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.759
We've always been friends.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.440
Right?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.639
Isn't this a bit too scummy?
