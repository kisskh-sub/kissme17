WEBVTT

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.119
Come here quickly.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:43.920
What's going on today?

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.240
So lavish!

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.399
I

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.320
want to ask you

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.359
for a small favor.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.600
Let me state upfront,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880
I refuse all filming.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.920
It's not about filming.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:55.799
Me,

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:56.759
I have a

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.359
Psychology Qualification Certificate exam next week.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.520
It's just the hypnosis part

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.960
that I'm still lacking in.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.039
So,

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.159
I want to ask you

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.280
to help me.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.319
So, be your guinea pig, huh?

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.879
A guinea pig that doesn't get knocked on the head.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.120
Now imagine

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.599
you're on a beach.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.280
The sea breeze

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:33.239
gently brushes your cheek.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.200
The warm sunlight

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.040
shines on your face.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.719
You feel

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.439
exceptionally comfortable.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.920
Now,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.200
can you talk about your ex-girlfriend?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.159
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.280
In your heart,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.560
are you still thinking about her?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.640
I don't know.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.719
This guy's lips are sealed tight, huh?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.439
Let's try a different way.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.159
You

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.599
had a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.759
memorable time together, just the two of you?

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.520
Scumbag.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.919
Your boss

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.319
is just a

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.639
little bastard.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.240
You

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.439
don't want

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.439
this wonderful time

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.919
to just end like this, do you?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080
After the cooperation ends,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.919
you break up peacefully.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.800
From then on, you never see each other again.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:08.439
Deal.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.560
Pleasure doing business.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.960
You love her,

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.719
right?

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.639
Love.

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.560
Do you want

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.280
to continue with her?

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:55.520
Want.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.319
You both still love each other,

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.039
yet neither is willing to back down.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.879
Sometimes, one turn away

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:03.960
means a lifetime.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.159
Since you two

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.080
both have feelings for each other,

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.879
then I'll help you find happiness.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.039
You can now slowly

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.080
open your eyes.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.879
How do you feel?

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.720
When did I fall asleep?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.720
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.800
Wake up.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.560
Let's go eat.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.560
Tomorrow is date day.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.720
Remember to keep your schedule clear.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:32.720
You

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.480
r dad still doesn't believe it?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.600
He's not that easy to convince.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.879
Actually, no one is watching us anymore.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.759
It's just

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.639
I simply want to go on a date with you.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.000
This is a good opportunity.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.079
Morning.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.079
You're riding this on your date today?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.079
This is called

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.600
a bicycle outing.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:09.759
Let's go.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.519
No way.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.560
Hello.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.399
Xin Tong.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.879
What a coincidence

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.160
running into you here.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.040
Long time no see.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.279
You

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.160
guys.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.800
Qixing

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.040
has already agreed to cooperate with us.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.959
She has now decided

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.680
to come to Four Seas' live stream

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.800
as a guest.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.680
Didn't the President say

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.759
to ignore that little bastard?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.600
I have my own plan.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.079
You two

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.439
We two

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.639
don't know each other.

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:50.560
Don't know each other.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.079
We two are old acquaintances.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.319
It's been so long,

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.800
you've kept your figure quite well.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.240
Your chest is still so big.

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:05.720
Why are you getting angry?

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:07.600
You're on a date?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.480
Yeah.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.040
No.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.560
Let me introduce you.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.920
This is my girlfriend,

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:16.480
Xin Tong.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.199
No need to use me to make your ex-girlfriend jealous.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.560
Besides, how could I possibly

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.600
make Qixing jealous?

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.160
We're on a date right now.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.000
So,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.439
since we're all so familiar,

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:30.360
why don't we

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.759
hang out together?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Exactly,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.839
we can all

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:35.680
catch up together.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.120
Let's go.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.560
Go.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.319
Have a good catch-up.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.680
You

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.319
What?

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.920
You know her relationship with the President, right?

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.879
Yeah, I know.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.399
She's the President's sister.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:07.040
Right.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.000
So what's the point of this little act?

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.399
I hope you two can reconcile.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.319
What did you say?

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:12.759
Wha-

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.680
Reconcile what?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.879
During the hypnosis...

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.120
what did you say?

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:18.680
I...

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.279
What did I say?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.839
You said...

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.000
you still love her.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.079
I love her?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.600
Who do I love?

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.800
I think that spot over there looks nice.

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.360
I'm going to shoot some vlog footage.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.720
Your girlfriend is quite pretty.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:58.560
What's your real purpose for coming today?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.519
I heard...

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.600
Dad said...

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.199
you can't take over the company unless you're in a relationship.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.000
So that's why you got a girlfriend.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.560
It's not fake, is it?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.839
What's it to you?

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.279
I'm just worried about you.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:16.800
Why are you snapping at me?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.800
As your sister,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.680
I'm just concerned about your future happiness.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.399
What's wrong?

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.600
I'm warning you now.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.839
Don't try any tricks with me.

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.879
Brother.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.600
These two...

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:36.720
really are a perfect match.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.840
How could I have any ulterior motives?

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.480
Should I just tell Dad directly...

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.840
that you're deceiving him?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.080
Little sister.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.480
What's wrong with you?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.879
I didn't finish my homework.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.759
I'm doomed.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.120
Take mine.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.440
But what about you, brother?

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:13.320
It's fine.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.240
Wen Pei'an.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.600
Go get your parents, now.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.919
You've really disappointed me.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:24.519
Respected Ms. Xiao Yan,

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:25.159
hello.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.360
I am from Class 1, Grade 10,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.639
Wen Pei'an.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.960
I have thoroughly researched

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.000
the situations of our two families.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.879
I believe you are the

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.240
best candidate to be my future partner.

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.159
Therefore,

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:39.440
I wish to discuss with you

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.000
a marriage alliance.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.600
Why did you do that just now?

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.759
I just wanted to help you.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.000
Wen Pei'an.

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:51.519
Go get your parents, now.

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:53.360
You've really disappointed me.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.879
Can you give this letter to your brother?

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:03.720
Sure.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.679
Wen Pei'an's reply to you.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:07.879
Thanks.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.480
Qixing.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.080
Why did you write a reply to her without permission?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.639
Brother.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I just thought...

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:27.600
this kind of thing would affect your studies.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.919
That's why I used harsh words.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:31.399
So...

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440
You're not...

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.879
going to scold me because of her, are you?

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:35.759
Wen Pei'an.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.600
Go get your parents, now.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:38.679
You...

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:42.080
You've really disappointed me.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.759
From childhood till now,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.080
my dear little sister

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.799
has always used the same method

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.559
to make her brother

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:55.519
become a child who disappoints our father.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.840
Now,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.759
she's looking at me with that same expression again.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.000
I won't be fooled by her look anymore.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.559
I already plan to get married.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:11.879
Believe it or not,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.240
I don't need to prove anything to you.

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:16.200
Then this matter becomes strange.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.200
Actually, Xin Tong invited me here today.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.759
She thought I was your...

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.919
ex-girlfriend.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.000
To get me to come as a guest,

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:28.600
she promised

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.919
to help you

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:30.559
and me

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.519
reconcile.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.799
Then I don't understand

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.039
what your girlfriend

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.039
means by this.

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:44.759
Is it for the company's sake?

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.879
How noble of you.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.600
You look...

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.559
a bit upset.

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.720
Her pushing you towards someone else...

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.759
hurt your pride.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.360
It couldn't be that she's faking it...

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:14.480
but you've fallen for real, brother?

00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:17.840
You knew it was a misunderstanding.

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.480
Why did you come to the meeting?

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:21.600
I couldn't just explain the misunderstanding away.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.799
I had to grit my teeth and come.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:26.679
Otherwise, it would be awkward for you.

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:28.759
Besides,

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:31.320
I just simply missed you.

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.720
You're not going to tattle to Dad, are you?

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.759
Brother.

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:39.080
I've grown up.

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:41.480
I will openly take back

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.360
everything that originally belonged to me.

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:44.759
What things?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.600
Management rights of the company.

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:51.519
Can you stop fooling around?

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.279
How am I fooling around?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.240
Why is it that when you boys

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.559
do something ambitious,

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:57.720
it's called having great aspirations,

00:12:58.039 --> 00:12:59.320
but when we girls do it, it's fooling around?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.240
Why?

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:02.879
Dad even said okay!

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.679
Xin Tong!

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:16.480
Are you okay?

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.440
I'm fine.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.639
I just twisted it.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:19.240
Let me see.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.000
It's nothing.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.240
I have weak ankles.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.080
Let me help you up.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:22.840
Thank you.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.679
Careful.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:27.399
I already told you.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:31.480
Qixing is still here.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.080
Put me down.

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:42.799
Wait for me to get the bike.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:43.559
Wait for me.

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:48.279
Qixing.

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:49.039
Sit, sit, sit.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.159
Sorry about that.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.799
I interrupted your reunion.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.879
It's fine.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.440
Since I signed the contract,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.159
no matter what,

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:59.279
I will fulfill my obligation

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.840
to be a guest.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.240
Any number of times is fine.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.600
You...

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.320
are even better than I imagined.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:10.960
I'm off.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.080
Bye.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:33.240
Where's Qixing?

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.080
Qixing said

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.399
she had something to do and left first.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:37.960
Here.

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:39.440
I can do it.

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:41.320
Slow down.

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:44.279
Sit tight.

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:49.519
Let's go.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.360
Stop worrying about my affairs.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.519
Alright?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.440
If you really like Qixing that much,

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:07.559
I have a way to persuade the President.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.879
What could you possibly do?

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.639
Then don't worry about it.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.399
Slow down a bit.
