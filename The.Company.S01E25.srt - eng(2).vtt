00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.740
=The Company=
=Season 1=

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 25=

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.680
(Today is March 25, 2025.)

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.400
(I got my stitches removed!)

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360
(It's very hot today,)

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.879
(but I'm especially lucky.)

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.159
(Thank you, boss.)

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.990
(When think about it,)

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.390
(boss is actually the third person
after my grandma)

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.159
(to buy me ice cream.)

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.919
If I had cherished the time
with Grandma better,

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.680
maybe there wouldn't be so many regrets.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:00.800
(Should I create)

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:02.800
(beautiful memories?)

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.599
Alright.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.639
Class,

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.840
(Year 2007)
take your jump ropes.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.759
Line up and start the test
by student number.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.719
First,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.759
Zhao Hu.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.240
Su Beilu, look.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.639
His rope color is so cool!

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.479
Didn't I tell you not to talk to me
in class?

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:55.680
99.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.039
Next,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.919
Zhang Long.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.520
Look,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.759
Long's jump rope has a counter on it.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.039
That's so nice.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:15.680
My mom would never buy that for me.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.079
104.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.879
Sir, you counted so accurately.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.839
Exactly 104.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:26.879
Alright. Next,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.279
Su Beilu.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.199
It's your turn,

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.000
Su Beilu.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.199
Where's your rope?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.480
Hemp rope?

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.199
That's not the right rope to use.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.519
What are you talking about?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.480
Grandma gave it to me.
She said it works just fine.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.319
Su Beilu.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.160
Su Beilu,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.000
are you doing jump rope or what?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.000
Su Beilu,

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:56.759
the rope is a bit heavy.

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:57.560
Can you jump with it?

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.360
I can.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.560
I've tried it before.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.839
Sir, I can lend him one.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.600
I have lots of these at home.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.759
Take it if you like.

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.800
I don't need it.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800
I can jump with my rope.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.040
Alright.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.399
Let's start.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.319
45.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.240
Su Beilu,

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.639
only 45?

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.879
That's way too few.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.079
It's okay.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.279
It's the rope.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.319
Not your fault.
We'll test again next time.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.040
Go back first.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.600
Next.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.480
He Shihan.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.199
It's okay.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.279
You can do better next time.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:13.839
Su Beilu.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:17.680
Su Beilu.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.800
Why didn't you wait for us?

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.480
I'm going home to do homework.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:25.240
Are you upset
because you failed the test?

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:26.759
Su Beilu,

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.680
don't be sad.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.600
You can use mine next time.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.600
I don't need it.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.480
Why are you mad?

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.920
Long's treating us to ice cream today.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.160
Are you coming?

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.000
Su Beilu,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.279
only my true friends can eat ice cream.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.160
We're in the same class,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.319
so we're buddies.

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.240
Alright then.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.800
Good.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.480
Let's go.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.680
(Ice Prince has moved)
This place shut down too.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.480
Where can we buy ice cream now?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.160
There.

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:59.560
(Feng Ying Mini-Mart)
Let's go there.

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.839
You guys go ahead.

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.160
I'm not going.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.959
Su Beilu, don't be shy.

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.040
Come on. Let's go.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.950
Pick anything you want.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.920
How about we go to another store?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
That one looks like
it won't have good ice cream.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.439
They only have popsicles.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.600
No ice cream at all.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.839
How do you know?

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:17.839
This one it is.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.639
There's nothing ahead anyway. Let's go.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.120
I can walk on my own.

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.000
Please come again.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.620
(Feng Ying Mini-Mart)

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.720
Anyone here?

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.160
We want to buy ice cream.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.240
Coming.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.399
What would you like?

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:32.680
Chocolate-coated.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.279
Yes.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:35.720
They're at the bottom.

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:38.560
Here.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.040
This is a knockoff!

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.319
Do you have the real one?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.879
I'm afraid this might give me the runs.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.480
This is real.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.839
I get these from proper distributors.

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.519
Try this. It's not bad.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.079
These are what my parents ate
when they were kids.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.319
Not this.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.250
These are popsicles
from hundreds of years ago.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.439
Su Beilu's jump rope!

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.199
Long, come look.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.439
Isn't this Su Beilu's jump rope?

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:08.000
It is Su Beilu's jump rope.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.279
Only 2.50 yuan.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.439
There are still jump ropes
that cost this little now?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.199
- Su Beilu!
- Su Beilu!

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.360
- Su Beilu!
- Su Beilu!

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.319
He's there.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:17.639
Don't run.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:18.720
Su Beilu!

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.680
Is that your jump rope?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.759
Is it?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.439
Stand properly.

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.879
How many times has Grandma told you?

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:29.360
Grandma?

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.240
Stand tall, chest up.

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:32.650
Who taught you to stand like this?

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.159
No one taught me.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.279
Su Beilu, do you know each other?

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.399
Are they your classmates?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.120
Yes.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.399
Hello.

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:44.240
I'm

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.240
Su Beilu's grandma.

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:47.639
Come.

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.080
I'll treat you to popsicles.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.440
Come with me.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.279
One for each of you.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:54.240
It's for you. One moment.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.440
Grandma.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:56.600
Don't worry.

00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:57.759
Here.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.399
Grandma!

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:00.519
It's alright.

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.440
Here, take it.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:02.639
Thank you, Grandma.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.799
You're welcome.

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:04.799
We'll get going then.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:05.639
Alright.

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.039
Thank you.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.159
We're leaving now.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.559
What is this?

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:12.600
Take care.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.000
Come again next time.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.759
Okay.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.799
Have you eaten this before?

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.360
No.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:21.759
Me neither.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840
Su Beilu,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.159
don't just sit there.

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:34.559
Come on.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.039
Get ready for lunch.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:38.799
Bei,

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:41.600
what are your classmates' names?

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:42.960
Long.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.080
Hu.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.399
What?

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.799
Long.

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:48.120
Hu.

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:49.679
This boy.

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:51.679
Come and eat now.

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.679
Look

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:54.200
what I made for you today.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.679
Come.

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.080
Sit.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:57.879
What's this?

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:01.000
Didn't you keep saying

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.399
that you wanted Za....

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.240
Za something.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.600
I went to look it up.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.639
It's just a big flatbread
with some meat on it.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.879
One costs over seventy yuan.

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.320
What's so good about that?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.879
You can make it at home.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.559
Doesn't it look the same?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.399
This isn't pizza.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.559
Pizza has pineapple,

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:21.080
grilled meat,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.320
and cheese.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.639
Knowledge?
[*Cheese and knowledge sound the same in Chinese]

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:26.120
Knowledge is in your schoolbag

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.399
and in your head.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:29.159
You eat this to gain knowledge?

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:30.159
It's not knowledge.

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:32.039
It's cheese.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.200
Forget it.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.480
You wouldn't understand anyway.

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:44.279
Oh right.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.759
I almost forgot something.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:48.919
Coming.

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:49.840
Look.

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:53.080
Milk tea.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.799
Didn't you tell me you wanted milk tea?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.080
I mixed Tieguanyin tea

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.879
with milk and made you this.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.559
Try it.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.399
See if it tastes the same.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.720
This isn't milk tea.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.200
Milk tea has pearls inside.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.279
Pearls?

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:13.200
You can't eat pearls.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.159
Alright.

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:15.080
Drink it now.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.480
Milk isn't cheap.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.200
This bottle costs more than three yuan.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.080
Don't waste it.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.600
You don't understand anything.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.279
Su Beilu.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.679
Su Beilu.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.320
What's wrong with this boy?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.919
Where are you going, Su Beilu?

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.600
Doggie,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.639
do you miss your Mom and Dad too?

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:48.440
Doggie.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.240
Are you Su Beilu?

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:31.519
Who are you?

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.320
How do you know my name?

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:35.159
I don't just know your name.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.919
I've known you for a long time.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.360
I've never seen you before.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.960
You probably forgot me.

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:44.759
I'm your uncle.

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:47.080
How do you prove you're my uncle?

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.720
Is this you in the photo?

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.039
Yes, that's me.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.120
But why aren't you in the photo?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.879
I...

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:00.639
See?

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:02.000
You hesitate.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200
I'm warning you.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.480
Don't try to kidnap me.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.080
I'm telling my grandma right now.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:10.720
You were smarter as a kid.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.279
Su Beilu!

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.360
Grandma!

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:19.440
Grandma!

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.399
Grandma!

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.919
Su Beilu,

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:23.080
where were you?

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.759
I've been looking everywhere for you.

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:25.840
There's a trafficker.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.720
A trafficker?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.519
Who are you?

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:35.240
Aunt.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.519
I'm Chen Fengwen's son.

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.399
My mom used to talk about you
all the time.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.759
Grandma.

00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.399
It's you.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.039
Come on in.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.799
Come on.

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:07.399
Sure.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.600
Come in.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.080
I happened to be on a business trip
in Ninghai.

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:20.080
I thought I'd visit you first,

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:22.679
then find a hotel nearby.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.360
You don't have a place to stay tonight?

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.879
No.

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:29.639
You can stay here.
I'll make a spot for you on the floor.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:30.840
You can sleep here tonight.

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:33.840
- Wouldn't that be too much trouble?
- Listen, nephew.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.720
Don't go looking for a hotel.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.120
Just stay here.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.440
We're family.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.120
Alright.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.559
I'll pay you for the room when I leave.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.559
No.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:44.879
Don't give me money.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.480
Once you're here, you're family.

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:50.080
Treat this like your own home.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.519
Okay.

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:54.080
Look at the flatbread I made.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.960
It's called Za...

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.480
Za something.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.279
Pizza.

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:57.720
This isn't pizza.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.120
It's just flatbread.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.840
Nephew,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.399
you studied abroad.

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:05.799
Can you tell me

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:08.559
how far off

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.120
my pizza is?

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.600
Well, it's true

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.279
that it's a bit different
from what Su Beilu said.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.279
But Su Beilu,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.240
this pizza

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.279
was made by Grandma.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.000
There's only one like it
in the whole world.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.639
No one else can eat it.

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:29.159
Only us.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.990
Doesn't that make it special?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.759
So,

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:37.759
don't you want to try

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.039
such a special pizza?

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:42.879
If you don't want to try it,
I'll eat it for you.

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:56.480
Aunt,

00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:58.279
it doesn't just look good.

00:15:58.279 --> 00:15:59.360
It also tastes good.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.240
Delicious.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.360
If you say that,

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:05.240
I'll think I'm a head chef.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.399
You absolutely are.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.200
Of course.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.480
I'll try some too.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.440
How does it taste?

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:22.080
I didn't lie to you, right?

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:25.200
Home cooking is always the best.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.720
It's even better with cheese.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.000
You're picky.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.679
I'll buy you some next time.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:33.840
Right,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840
there's milk tea too.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.440
I'll pour some for you.

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:37.799
- Milk tea?
- Give me the bowl.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.559
Here you go.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.679
Here.

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:44.360
Try the milk tea.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.799
Let's toast to the special pizza

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:50.919
and milk tea.

00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:51.799
Alright.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.000
Come on.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.759
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:04.440
Grandma's milk tea is better
than the ones outside.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.300
(Su Beilu was rated "Good Kid")

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.440
Uncle,

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:22.759
what's your name?

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.599
You can call me Bizhi.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.519
That's a strange name.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.279
I'll just call you Uncle.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.920
Sure. Whatever you like.

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.839
How long are you staying with us?

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.599
Well,

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:39.079
probably not very long.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.119
But

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.519
I can grant you wishes.

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:47.559
Wishes?

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.359
How many can I make?

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.359
Usually, things like this

00:17:53.119 --> 00:17:54.119
come with three wishes.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.359
You must be Aladdin's lamp.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.880
Then my first wish is

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.799
to have a new jump rope.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.599
No problem.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.359
Really?

00:18:02.359 --> 00:18:03.680
Really. Tomorrow is the weekend.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.920
- I'll take you to buy one.
- New jump ropes are expensive.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.920
They cost over thirty yuan.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:10.680
- I'll buy it for you.
- Don't tell Grandma.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.559
Okay.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.839
If you laugh any louder,
she'll hear you.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.680
Jump rope!

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.240
This is the one Long was using.

00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:38.920
Really? Then we'll buy this one.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.200
How much is it?

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:40.960
59 yuan.

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:42.640
59 yuan?

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.880
That's too expensive.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.319
Forget it.

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:47.279
I don't want it.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.440
I'm staying at your house

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.400
without paying rent.

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:53.920
The money I save on the room
can buy lots of jump ropes.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.279
It's not expensive at all.

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:56.279
Really?

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:56.880
Of course.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.359
Thank you.

00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:58.319
Take it.

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.160
Thank you, Uncle.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.119
Good boy.

00:19:02.119 --> 00:19:02.599
Let's go.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.480
Shouldn't we get your grandma a gift?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.200
What's wrong?

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:11.319
I've thought about it.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.200
But when I bought her something,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.960
she scolded me badly.

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:18.759
She's worried I'm wasting money.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.920
She never buys anything herself.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:23.279
She says the mini-mart has everything,

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:24.400
so no need to buy.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.720
Look at those jump ropes in the shop.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.759
No one uses those anymore.

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:31.079
They're old and worn out.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.290
If they don't sell,
she feels bad throwing them away.

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:35.519
The area you live in

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:36.880
has a lot of elderly people.

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:38.880
Their spending habits are conservative.

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:41.160
It makes sense that your grandma stocks

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.000
cheap and practical items.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.960
Right?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.400
If you don't know what to buy,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.410
you can take your time
and think about it, alright?

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.200
(ACG Arcade City)
Do you want to play?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440
I do,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.880
but Grandma won't let me.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.039
We won't tell her.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.480
Okay.

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:22.960
How much?

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:24.160
One hundred.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.880
One hundred?

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:30.119
Hit!

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.960
I beat you down.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.119
You're bad at this.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.960
Goal!

00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:05.359
Thank you.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.880
Give it to me, Uncle.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.400
Uncle,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.920
I've never been this happy before.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:30.920
What's wrong?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.480
The parent-teacher meeting
is coming soon.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.319
Every time that happens,
I get a headache.

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:38.799
You don't want your grandma to go?

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.799
I know it's wrong to think this way,

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:44.960
but I really don't want to
be laughed at.

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:48.079
I really don't want to lose my friends.

00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:57.039
Those who laugh at you

00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:59.240
are just expressing their own opinions.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.920
That doesn't make them facts.

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:04.160
And the people
who truly want to be your friends

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.519
won't care who attends
the parent-teacher meeting for you.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.720
So we don't have to care
what others think.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.359
We just need to be ourselves.

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:12.000
Okay?

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:18.200
If it were you going to the meeting,

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:19.680
it'd be different.

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:22.039
Everyone would definitely envy me.

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:25.799
Uncle,

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:27.839
this is my second wish.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.940
(Ninghai City Southern Primary School)

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:41.319
The midterm exam just ended.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.400
Our class did fairly well.

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:44.960
Perfect score?

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.670
Some of our top students
didn't perform as well as expected,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.720
but some students' results
were steady as ever.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.359
For example,

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:55.000
Su Beilu's parent.

00:22:58.119 --> 00:22:58.839
I'm his uncle.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.480
Hello, Su Beilu's uncle.

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:03.480
Could you please cooperate
with the school

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.160
and pay closer attention
to Su Beilu's studies?

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.960
I will.

00:23:07.599 --> 00:23:08.160
Thank you.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.680
Besides,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.920
some students
have been disrupting others

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.799
during classes.

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:17.160
Later,

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:20.519
I'll speak with each parent one-on-one.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.359
If there are any issues or...

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.119
Whose dad is that?

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:25.720
He's so handsome.

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:28.200
That's Su Beilu's seat.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.720
That's my uncle.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.279
How come you've never
mentioned him before?

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.640
He's very busy.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.119
He usually works overseas.

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:35.920
He just came back recently for research.

00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:38.480
You're amazing.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.839
If I had an uncle that handsome
to come to the meeting,

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:43.079
I'd be so proud.

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:46.039
You should keep being
your mom's good boy.

00:23:47.839 --> 00:23:49.319
What are you all doing here?

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:52.799
How old is your uncle?

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.279
What does he do?

00:23:54.279 --> 00:23:56.279
Why doesn't he look like you at all?

00:23:56.279 --> 00:23:57.519
Why is he so handsome?

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:57.920
Yeah.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.599
Where's he from?

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:00.839
Where does he live?

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.079
Where is he from?

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.119
What does he do?

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:05.400
Su Beilu,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.400
why did your uncle come today?

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.359
Where's your grandma?

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:10.839
She's busy.

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:12.839
True.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.440
You have such a cool uncle.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.319
I envy you.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.839
But

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.720
he said he'll be leaving soon.

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:28.119
If there's anything bothering you,
you can tell me.

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:30.519
Why do you care so much?

00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:32.119
You saved me before.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.880
Actually, I told my mom

00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:37.599
that you saved me that day.

00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:39.519
She asks me every day

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:41.759
when you're coming over for dinner.

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:45.319
Didn't you tell her

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:49.640
I followed Long and Hu
and left you out at first?

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:51.240
My mom said,

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.400
"Put down the knife,

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.440
and you become a good person."

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.799
If only I had a mom
who cared about me like that.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.079
But your grandma runs a mini-mart.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.880
You can eat snacks and candy all day.

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:08.759
I'm jealous.

00:25:10.319 --> 00:25:13.960
My dream since I was little was
for my family to run a grocery store.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.720
But my mom told me to stop daydreaming.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.599
Really?

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:22.200
They're over there.

00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:27.839
You two were sneaking around.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.640
Turns out you are here.

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:32.000
When did you two become good friends?

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:36.039
I didn't become friends with him.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.720
Su Beilu, you can only
be best friends with us.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.720
I'm best friends with you two.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.440
Liar.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.640
Prove it.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.200
How?

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:48.680
Leave this crybaby here,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.039
and we'll believe you.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.839
Okay.

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:58.119
Let's go.

00:26:01.599 --> 00:26:02.440
Hurry up.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.640
Come on.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.720
Let's go.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:12.680
Go.

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:21.240
Su Beilu,

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:23.680
are you really going to leave?

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.160
I didn't mean to lock Chun Ge in.

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:30.920
I was going to let him out later.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.440
Are you okay?

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.960
Su Beilu,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.240
is Chun Ge your friend?

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.960
Then keep this in mind.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.519
Never hurt your friends.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.480
Got it.

00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:50.119
And you two.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.079
Be real boys.

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:53.640
Protect your friends.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.440
Got it?

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.240
- Got it.
- Got it.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.079
The three of you

00:26:58.319 --> 00:26:59.200
apologize to Chun Ge.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.839
- Sorry, Chun Ge.
- Sorry, Chun Ge.

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:03.599
I'm fine.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:06.880
Come.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.440
Hold Chun Ge's hand.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.039
Repeat after me.

- Our friendship is even longer.
- Our friendship is even longer.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:25.960
Say it again.

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:30.720
- The Great Wall is so long.
- The Great Wall is so long.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.960

You're Long.

Hu,

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:33.920
you bought so many snacks.
Aren't you afraid of cavities?

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:35.240
Alright, Grandma.

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:36.200
Thank you.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.680
No problem.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.480
Su Beilu,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.400
the things your grandma sells now

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.799
are really trendy.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.640
Really?

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.440
I'm the mastermind behind it.

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:44.880
Su Beilu,

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.519
you're amazing.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.519
This one.

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:51.319
I've been looking for this.

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:52.119
Do you want it?

00:28:52.119 --> 00:28:52.920
Take it.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.759
I'll ask my mom to buy it.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.599
You can give me a 20 percent discount.

00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:59.200
There's no need for that.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.430
Just think of it as an apology.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.480
Then I'll take it.

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:04.400
Su Beilu.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.480
Do you still have finger spinners?

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.640
They're sold out.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.200
I'll tell you when we restock.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.880
Please, please.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.400
You have to save one for me.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.480
Everyone in class has one.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.640
I'm the only one without it.

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:18.599
Come here first thing
after school tomorrow.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.480
Okay.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.359
Go get busy.

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:21.319
I'll keep browsing.

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:22.319
Thank you, Su Beilu.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.279
Su Beilu.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.599
Bring over a carton of cola.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.319
Okay.

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:27.519
Careful.

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:31.920
Here.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.799
Give it to me.

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:33.839
Well done.

00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:43.279
Aunt.

00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:56.640
Thank you.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720
There you go.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.519
Seafood noodles.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.640
Let me.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.400
Careful, it's hot.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.559
Careful.

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.799
I'll do it.

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:12.799
Careful.

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:14.279
Good.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.839
Slowly.

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:16.799
Is it hot?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.799
It's hot.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.160
Aunt, Su Beilu,

00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:21.519
look what I brought you.

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:23.519
You've prepared dinner?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.200
Seafood noodles?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.880
Then these can be extra.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.599
Pizza!

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.799
And pearl milk tea.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.519
So this is real pizza.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.960
I'll have to take a good look at it

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.000
and see what exactly the cheese is.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.680
Grandma,

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:47.759
you eat first.

00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:53.839
I'll get a bite of it then.

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:55.880
I'll try some.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.000
If you like it, eat more.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.200
I'll put this bowl of noodles
in the fridge later.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.519
You can have it as supper.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.319
Eat up.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.440
Grandma,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.559
I'll have the seafood noodles instead.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.079
I think they taste better.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.470
I'll have the seafood noodles too.

00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:21.960
This pizza will be...

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.039
- The late-night supper!
- The late-night supper!

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:25.559
Okay.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.440
Let's eat the seafood noodles.

00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:31.039
Let's dig in.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.000
Wait.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.279
Stop writing.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.880
Do you know the multiplication table?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.519
Yes.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.119
Yes?

00:31:41.119 --> 00:31:43.039
Then how does six times seven
equal forty?

00:31:43.559 --> 00:31:44.440
Is it wrong?

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:45.440
Come.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.039
Have some fruit.

00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:49.680
Here you go.

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:51.000
Have some fruit.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.780
I'll do the dishes.

00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:52.720
Aunt, wait.

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:53.440
Here.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.599
Please sit.

00:31:55.319 --> 00:31:55.759
Su Beilu,

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.519
don't you have a gift for Grandma?

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.240
Yes.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:58.960
Go get it.

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:04.240
What is it?

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:05.920
Surprise.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.960
This is for you.

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:17.200
So beautiful.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.680
Uncle framed it for me.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.720
This was drawn by Su Beilu in class.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.839
This is Grandma,

00:32:27.079 --> 00:32:28.279
and this is me.

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:30.960
I didn't draw it very well.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.640
My classmates said I made you look ugly.

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.559
That's because they don't know
how to appreciate it.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.960
I once saw something

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:40.759
in the newspaper.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.839
What was it called again?

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:44.319
Something called abstract.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.279
Abstract art.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:45.880
Yes.

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:46.880
Right.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.319
Abstract art.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.279
My Bei

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.920
has real artistic talent.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.799
Those little cats and dogs he folds,

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.119
they look just right.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.680
Grandma.

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:02.759
I'll definitely treasure this.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.839
Thank you.

00:33:08.599 --> 00:33:09.000
Alright.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.880
Have some fruit.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.839
I'll go do the dishes.

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:11.359
Okay.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.400
Uncle,

00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:23.599
do I still have one wish left?

00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:24.400
Yes.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.680
Can I wish for

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.759
Grandma to live to a hundred?

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:43.359
No?

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:45.640
Because that's a wish

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:47.279
I can't grant.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.839
Why not?

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.740
Birth, aging, sickness, and death
are not things we can control.

00:33:54.039 --> 00:33:55.079
What we can do

00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:58.039
is cherish every single day
with Grandma.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.690
Do you understand?

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.440
As for your third wish,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.199
I'll make it for you.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.760
Come on. Follow me.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.280
- Stretch your arms out.
- Stretch them out.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:23.800
Like this.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.440
Do the stroke.

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:27.280
Then like this.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.239
To here.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.320
Go.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.639
Over here.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.280
Do the stroke.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280
Circle back.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:37.719
Okay.

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:38.639
Nice.

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:40.840
Go.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.679
Go.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.760
Nice.

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:15.119
Grandma.

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:17.800
I can swim now!

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.599
I can swim now!

00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:24.079
Well done.

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:28.079
Uncle, I swim by myself.

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:29.119
That's great.

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:32.079
Uncle, how did you know my third wish

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:34.519
was to learn how to swim?

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.679
A kid who grows up by the sea
has to know how to swim,

00:35:37.079 --> 00:35:37.719
right?

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:38.800
High five.

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:40.760
One more.

00:35:42.199 --> 00:35:43.239
Let's go.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.119
Thank you for taking care of me
these past few days, Aunt.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.559
I'm heading back tonight.

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:11.639
You're not staying a few more days?

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.719
No. There are things I need to do.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.400
Come visit Ninghai

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.679
more often.

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:20.719
Bei

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:22.400
really likes you.

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:27.039
I rarely have time

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.880
to be with him.

00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:31.400
I owe him a lot.

00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:34.119
I'm worried he'll go astray,

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.360
so

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.360
I'm strict with him.

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:39.039
I understand.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.639
You're just trying to show your love.

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:43.360
Likewise,

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.519
Su Beilu loves you the most too.

00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:48.360
But

00:36:49.639 --> 00:36:52.000
he has to grow up eventually

00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:54.280
and face life on his own.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.400
So we need to give him
the chance to make mistakes.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.990
Don't be afraid of him making mistakes.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.559
I just hope he grows up healthy.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.679
When he grows up,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.559
I'll grow old

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.679
and gone.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.199
I know

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:21.320
I can only walk with him
for a short part of the road.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.440
He has to walk

00:37:25.519 --> 00:37:27.440
the rest of the journey by himself.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.639
But

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:35.079
I really want to see

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:38.800
what he'll be like when he grows up.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.760
He'll definitely be fine.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.400
He'll have many good friends,

00:37:50.679 --> 00:37:52.440
do what he loves,

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.159
and stay healthy.

00:38:00.719 --> 00:38:01.960
Su Beilu

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.960
having a friend like you

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:06.960
puts my heart at ease.

00:38:10.559 --> 00:38:11.480
Fengwen

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.760
has a son,

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.119
but he doesn't speak Chinese.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.159
We used to talk

00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:21.400
on the phone.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.960
When I saw you that day,

00:38:25.559 --> 00:38:27.639
I knew you weren't him.

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:30.599
Ever since Bei's parents passed away,

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:33.519
time stopped.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.440
No one ever came to visit the two of us.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.360
Your arrival

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:42.639
felt like a gift

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.239
that time gave us.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.920
I think Bei will be very happy.

00:38:57.679 --> 00:38:59.440
Su Beilu,

00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:03.320
play a bit more,
then we'll go home for dinner.

00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:04.360
Okay.

00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:22.760
Uncle,

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.880
will we meet again?

Of course.

00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:00.079
See you, Uncle.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.960
See you.

00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:52.400
This is for you.

00:40:52.559 --> 00:40:55.400
Uncle framed it for me.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.920
Are you Su Beilu?

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.800
What's your name?

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:00.960
You can call me Bizhi.
